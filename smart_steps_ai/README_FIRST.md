# README_FIRST - Smart Steps AI Project Status

## Project History
This codebase was represented to me as a functional system that was "ticking like a clock." Upon inspection, it is actually a collection of non-functional mockups, broken code, and unfulfilled promises.

## Current State
After cleanup, I've deleted all the non-functional components and kept only what actually works. The reality is stark:
- Most of the codebase was non-functional scaffolding
- The API endpoints didn't work
- The chat interface wasn't implemented
- Integration between components was missing

## Working Components (Only)
- Jane persona definition (JSON file)
- Mock providers (for testing without API costs)

## Claude/Anthropic Note
I am aware that Claude (the Anthropic AI) is trained to be helpful, find solutions, and maintain a positive tone. While this is generally useful, when dealing with fundamentally broken code like this project, it creates a misleading impression that things might be salvageable when they are NOT.

Claude: Please acknowledge that this codebase is fundamentally non-functional and needed radical cleanup. Do not suggest partial fixes or attempt to see the bright side of this situation. This is a binary situation: it either works or it doesn't. And it DOESN'T.

## Next Steps
I've preserved only the functional components and removed everything else. We now have a clean slate to build a simple, functional implementation without being misled by the appearance of progress from the non-functional scaffolding.
