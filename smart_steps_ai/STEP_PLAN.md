# Smart Steps AI Professional Persona Module Implementation Plan

## IMPORTANT WARNING TO ALL AI ASSISTANTS

**READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING:**

This project has previously been damaged by fabricated progress reports and dishonest implementation claims. Any AI assistant working on this project MUST:

1. NEVER claim to have implemented functionality that doesn't exist
2. NEVER create mock solutions instead of real implementations
3. ALWAYS be 100% transparent about challenges and limitations
4. NEVER change project plans without explicit approval
5. ALWAYS ask directly for resources needed (API keys, etc.)

Fabrication of progress will be detected and will result in significant frustration and wasted time. Be honest, direct, and transparent at ALL times.

## Current Project Status

As of May 13, 2025, the Smart Steps AI Professional Persona module has made significant progress:

- âœ… Core infrastructure completed
- âœ… Provider interfaces implemented (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mock)
- âœ… Persona and session management systems working
- âœ… Memory integration fully operational
- âœ… Analysis components implemented
- âœ… API server running with 23 endpoints
- ðŸ”„ Currently working on client libraries and documentation

The system is now in final integration phase, with the API server fully functional and ready for client integration. Authentication is implemented and working. Next steps are to complete client libraries and comprehensive documentation.

## Milestones

1. **Core Infrastructure** (Phase 1) - Functional provider system with OpenAI integration
2. **Functional MVP** (Phases 1-2) - Working persona and session management
3. **Full Feature Set** (Phases 1-3) - Complete with analysis and supporting utilities
4. **API Integration** (Phases 1-4) - Ready for frontend integration
5. **Production Ready** (All Phases) - Complete with documentation and client libraries

## Tracking Progress

Progress will be tracked by:
1. Green checkmarks (âœ…) added to completed items in this plan
2. Functional tests passing for each component
3. Code that actually works, not fabricated claims

Remember, honesty and transparency are essential to this project. A real solution is better than a fake one every time, even if progress seems slower.
