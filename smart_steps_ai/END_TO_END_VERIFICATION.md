# Smart Steps AI End-to-End Verification Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive verification process for the Smart Steps AI Professional Persona module to ensure all components work together correctly in a production environment.

## Verification Goals

The end-to-end verification aims to validate:

1. **API Server Functionality**: Ensure the API server functions correctly with proper authentication
2. **Monitoring System**: Verify that monitoring captures metrics correctly and maintenance functions work
3. **Deployment Process**: Test the deployment process in a clean environment
4. **Integration**: Confirm that all components work together seamlessly

## Prerequisites

Before running the verification, ensure the following:

* A clean environment for testing (VM, container, or isolated server)
* Python 3.9+ installed
* Git access to the repository
* Network access to required services
* Administrative access to the test environment

## Verification Tools

The verification process uses the `verify_system.py` script, which provides automated testing of all system components. The script:

* Tests API authentication and functionality
* Verifies monitoring system metrics
* Validates deployment configurations
* Ensures proper integration between components

## Verification Process

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/smart-steps-ai.git
cd smart-steps-ai

# Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Configure Test Environment

```bash
# Copy development environment for testing
cp deployment/config/development.env .env

# Edit .env with appropriate test settings
# - Set DEBUG=True
# - Set DEFAULT_PROVIDER=mock
# - Set API_SECRET_KEY to a test value
```

### 3. Start Services

```bash
# Start the API server
python run_api_server.py

# In a separate terminal/session, start the monitoring system
python deployment/monitoring_system.py start
```

### 4. Run Verification Tests

```bash
# Run all verification tests
python verify_system.py --all

# Or run specific test groups
python verify_system.py --api-auth
python verify_system.py --monitoring
python verify_system.py --deployment
```

### 5. Review Results

The verification script will:
* Output results to the console
* Generate a detailed log file
* Save a JSON results file in the temp directory

Review these files to identify any issues that need to be addressed.

## Test Scenarios

### API Server Authentication Tests

| Test ID | Test Name | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| API-01 | API Health Check | Verify the API server is running | 200 OK response |
| API-02 | API Authentication | Test login with valid credentials | Receive valid JWT token |
| API-03 | Protected Endpoint Access | Test access to protected endpoint | 200 OK with user data |
| API-04 | Session Creation | Create a new therapy session | 201 Created with session ID |
| API-05 | Message Exchange | Send and receive messages in a session | 200 OK with messages |
| API-06 | Persona Listing | Get list of available personas | 200 OK with list of personas |

### Monitoring System Tests

| Test ID | Test Name | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| MON-01 | Monitoring Health Check | Verify monitoring is running | 200 OK with status info |
| MON-02 | Metrics Endpoint | Check metrics collection | 200 OK with system metrics |
| MON-03 | Cache Clearing | Test cache clearing functionality | 200 OK with success message |
| MON-04 | Maintenance Endpoint | Test maintenance functionality | 200 OK with success message |

### Deployment Configuration Tests

| Test ID | Test Name | Description | Expected Result |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| DEP-01 | Docker Configuration | Verify Docker files | Files exist and are valid |
| DEP-02 | Environment Configurations | Check environment files | Files exist with required settings |
| DEP-03 | Release Management | Test release management script | Script exists and is valid |
| DEP-04 | Monitoring Configuration | Verify monitoring config | File exists with required sections |
| DEP-05 | Backup System | Test backup system | Script exists and is valid |

## Failure Scenarios and Mitigation

| Failure Point | Potential Causes | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------------|------------|
| API Server won't start | Port conflict, missing dependencies, invalid config | Check logs, verify port availability, confirm all dependencies installed |
| Authentication fails | Invalid credentials, JWT issues, encryption problems | Verify API_SECRET_KEY, check token expiration, confirm encryption libraries |
| Monitoring system not collecting metrics | Permission issues, configuration errors | Verify monitoring.yaml settings, check logs, confirm permissions |
| Deployment configuration issues | Missing files, syntax errors | Restore from templates, validate YAML/configuration syntax |
| Database connectivity issues | Connection string, permissions, database not running | Verify database settings, check database status |

## Clean Environment Testing

To test in a completely clean environment:

1. **Docker-based testing**:
   ```bash
   # Build and start services
   docker-compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up -d
   
   # Run verification against containerized services
   python verify_system.py --all --api-url http://localhost:9500
   ```

2. **Virtual Machine testing**:
   * Set up a clean VM using the provided OS requirements
   * Clone the repository and follow the installation instructions
   * Run the verification script to validate all components

## Verification Acceptance Criteria

The verification is considered successful when:

1. All API tests pass, confirming proper authentication and functionality
2. All monitoring tests pass, confirming metrics collection and maintenance
3. All deployment tests pass, confirming proper configuration
4. The system can be deployed in a clean environment without errors
5. The verification script completes with an exit code of 0

## Post-Verification Steps

After successful verification:

1. Generate a verification report using the results JSON
2. Tag the repository version as verified
3. Update the deployment documentation with any findings
4. Prepare for staging deployment

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### API Authentication Issues

```
Test API Authentication failed: Unexpected status code 401
```

**Solutions**:
* Verify username and password in the test script
* Check API_SECRET_KEY in .env file
* Ensure JWT_ALGORITHM is set correctly

### Monitoring System Issues

```
Test Monitoring Health Check failed: Connection refused
```

**Solutions**:
* Verify monitoring service is running
* Check if monitoring is running on the expected port
* Confirm firewall settings allow access

### Deployment Configuration Issues

```
Test Docker Configuration failed: Missing files
```

**Solutions**:
* Verify all Docker configuration files exist
* Check file permissions
* Ensure the repository was fully cloned

## Conclusion

This verification plan provides a comprehensive approach to testing the Smart Steps AI system. By following this plan, you can ensure that all components are working correctly and that the system is ready for production deployment.

The automated verification script simplifies this process and provides detailed feedback to identify and resolve any issues that may arise.
