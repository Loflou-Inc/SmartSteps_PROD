Jane’s Middle Childhood (Ages 7–12): Trauma and
Coping
Sexual Abuse by a Stepparent: Effects and Dynamics
• Children sexually abused by a parent or stepparent often suffer severe, long-term trauma. Studies
link such abuse to chronic PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and later substance
problems 1 . Abuse by a family member (incest) typically produces worse outcomes than abuse by
outsiders 2 . For example, victims of father-daughter or stepfather-stepdaughter incest report
feeling deeply “damaged,” with persistent guilt, shame, worthlessness and interpersonal problems
3 1 .
• Intrafamilial abuse is marked by secrecy and betrayal. Courtois and Kluft note that incest survivors
almost always experience secrecy, conflicted loyalty, powerlessness and fear of reprisal 4 . The
average incestuous abuse in families lasts years; prolonged abuse (especially beginning in early
childhood) typically leads to avoidant coping and dissociative defenses 5 . In Jane’s case, a hidden,
long-term sexual betrayal by a trusted stepfather would likely induce severe trauma bonding and
avoidance – the child may unconsciously dissociate or “freeze” during abuse 5 6 .
• The family’s response often compounds the harm. Research reports that mothers sometimes
disbelieve children who accuse a stepfather 7 , and communities in that era were often reluctant to
discuss child sex abuse. Betrayal trauma theory predicts a child will stay silent if disclosure could
jeopardize the family or if authorities are dismissive. As a result, Jane likely learned to keep the abuse
secret, deepening her isolation and self-blame 4 7 .
Dissociation and Trauma in Children
• Dissociation as a defense: Traumatized children frequently use dissociation to cope. When an event
becomes overwhelming, a child may mentally detach – feeling as though onlookers, “on the ceiling,”
or in a dream rather than fully present 6 . This protects them from unbearable fear or pain. In
complex or repeated abuse, dissociation can become an automatic stress response 8 5 .
• Manifestations: In everyday life, Jane might seem to “space out” or stare off, disconnected from
class or play. Clinicians note that abused children may later have gaps in memory or sense time loss,
as if experiences “happened to someone else” 6 . Once established, dissociation can impair
concentration and classroom learning, and can make the child appear distant or “in her own
world” 8 9 .
Precocious or Adult-Like Behavior as Coping
• Hyperverbal coping: Some gifted or highly sensitive abused children cope by seeming unusually
mature. Jane may have used advanced vocabulary or adult topics as a shield. Psychologically, this
can be seen as intellectualization or a “false self.” Alice Miller observed that trauma survivors often
over-attune to adult expectations and suppress their own feelings 10 . In practice, Jane’s precocious
1

manner might have been a survival strategy – appearing capable and compliant to avoid further
conflict (akin to a “little adult” persona).
• Parentification: A related pattern is parentification – taking on adult roles prematurely. Gifted
children (especially in stressed families) often step in to help parents with tasks or emotions 11 .
Miller and others note that a sensitive child may become caregiver to an adult, concealing her own
needs. This matches reports that Jane could have seemed unusually responsible or eager to please,
masking the trauma at home 11 10 .
Giftedness and Masking Inner Turmoil
• Gifted children sometimes develop their intellectual abilities in response to emotional neglect or
trauma. Miller argued that a highly intelligent child in a dysfunctional family might learn that
academic or verbal skill is what the parents value, thus a way to gain approval 10 . In effect, Jane’s
intellect could serve as camouflage for her pain. For instance, her academic precocity or “adult”
demeanor might have impressed teachers and neighbors, causing them to overlook her distress.
Research on “gifted trauma” suggests these children can appear well-adjusted externally while
hiding a “false self” of achievement 10 .
• Gifted kids can also be “invisible victims.” One writer notes that parents sometimes feel threatened
by a gifted child’s insight or honesty 12 , reacting with subtle rejection. To cope, the child shrinks her
true self. In Jane’s case, her high verbal ability might have effectively masked her emotional
suffering; observers would see a smart, talkative child, not realizing that these traits help her endure
abuse 10 12 .
Early Journaling and Symbolic Writing as Coping
• Therapeutic writing: Psychologists have long studied expressive writing about trauma. James
Pennebaker’s experiments showed that writing repeatedly about one’s deepest fears and feelings
leads to improved mental and physical health 13 14 . Those who put their traumatic experiences
into words later reported less depression, anxiety, stress and higher self-esteem 15 13 .
• Emotional processing: Pennebaker’s theory is that journaling organizes “chaotic thoughts” and
releases pent-up emotions 16 . For a child like Jane, a secret diary or symbolic stories could serve a
similar function: a private outlet to express what she could not say aloud. Contemporary guides to
trauma emphasize that writing can help children modulate arousal and integrate memories. Thus,
Jane’s possible early journals or fantasy writing may have been an unconscious self-therapy, a way to
process her abuse and calm her anxiety 13 15 .
Historical Context (1970s–1980s Midwest)
• CSA awareness: In Jane’s era, national awareness of child sexual abuse was only just emerging. Until
the 1974 Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), there was no uniform reporting
requirement in the U.S. 17 . Even after CAPTA, many adults in the late 1970s still assumed “good”
families weren’t affected or that children would “bounce back,” often minimizing abuse 18 . In the
Midwest, a quiet, religious region, discussions of sex and abuse were especially taboo. A girl acting
adult or journaling privately would likely be labeled “bright” or “shy,” not recognized as signaling
trauma.
• Psychology of the time: Professional child psychiatry in the 1970s focused on overt symptoms and
crisis intervention 19 . The concept of dissociation in children was known academically (descended
2

from 19th-century psychiatry) but not part of common vernacular; spacey or withdrawn kids were
often thought slow or dreamy rather than traumatized 6 . Likewise, the idea that writing could heal
was not mainstream: private diaries were seen as normal childhood creativity or kept secrets, not as
therapeutic tools. Overall, Jane’s precocious self-therapy (journaling, acting grown-up) would have
been largely invisible to observers, and her abuse grievously under-recognized by society and even
many professionals 20 19 .
