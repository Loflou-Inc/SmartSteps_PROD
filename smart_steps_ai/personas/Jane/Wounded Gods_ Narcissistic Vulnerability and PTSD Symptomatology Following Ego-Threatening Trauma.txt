Wounded Gods: Narcissistic Vulnerability and
PTSD Symptomatology Following Ego-Threatening
Trauma
Abstract
This proposed dissertation examines how individuals high in vulnerable narcissism respond to ego-
threatening versus physically threatening traumatic memories. Vulnerable narcissism – a personality style
marked by hypersensitivity, shame-proneness, and fragile self-worth – has been linked to more severe PTSD
symptoms after trauma 1 2 . However, its interaction with different trauma types (e.g. social humiliation
vs. physical assault) is not well understood. Using a mixed-methods design with outpatient clients,
participants will complete the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) to quantify vulnerability, then be
randomly prompted to recall either a profound episode of public humiliation or physical assault. Outcome
measures include PTSD symptoms (via the PCL-5) 3 , affect (PANAS), dissociative experiences (DES-II) 4 ,
and physiological stress markers (salivary cortisol and heart rate variability). It is hypothesized that high-
vulnerability individuals will exhibit greater PTSD symptom severity, negative affect, and physiological stress
when recalling humiliation than assault, compared to lower-vulnerability peers. Qualitative interviews will
explore personal meaning and emotion regulation. Anticipated findings would support theories that ego
threats (social status losses) provoke intense shame and stress responses similar to physical danger 5
6 . Clinical implications include screening for narcissistic vulnerability in trauma survivors and tailoring
interventions (e.g., shame-focused therapies, compassion-based strategies) for those with injury to self-
esteem. The study will carefully integrate multicultural perspectives (e.g., varying cultural norms of honor
and shame) and rigorous ethical safeguards (informed consent, emotional support) in its design and
interpretation.
Introduction
Pathological narcissism comprises two interwoven themes: grandiosity (inflated self-views, entitlement)
and vulnerability (fragile self-esteem, hypersensitivity to criticism) 7 8 . Traditional diagnostic criteria
(DSM-5 NPD) emphasize the grandiose side, but clinical models recognize that many narcissistic patients
present primarily in a vulnerable state – marked by anxiety, shame, and emotional dysregulation 9 2 .
Vulnerable narcissists may appear shy, avoidant, or depressed, but underlying these states is a fluctuating
yet brittle sense of self-worth that desperately seeks validation 1 2 .
Trauma exposure is often conceptualized as an external event causing fear and helplessness, but not all
traumas threaten the same goals. One important dimension is whether a trauma assaults one’s ego or
social standing (e.g., public humiliation) versus more prototypical physical threat (e.g., assault).
Humiliation may be experienced as a direct injury to the self, evoking intense shame and anger 5 . Social
self-preservation theory posits that humans maintain a “social self” tied to esteem and status; threats to this
system (such as ostracism or humiliation) activate biological stress responses (cortisol release, arousal)
1

similarly to threats to physical safety 6 . Vulnerable narcissists, with their chronic fear of losing status and
pervasive shame, may be especially reactive to ego-threatening trauma.
Empirical evidence links vulnerable narcissism to greater PTSD symptoms. For example, veterans higher in
vulnerable narcissistic traits report significantly more severe PTSD, whereas grandiose traits show no such
effect 1 . This suggests that the insecure, shame-prone qualities of vulnerability amplify traumatic stress.
However, most research has been correlational and has not isolated trauma types or physiological
reactions. The present dissertation aims to fill this gap by experimentally comparing responses to social
(humiliation) versus physical trauma recall in relation to vulnerable narcissism. By integrating self-report,
physiological, and narrative data, the study will yield a rich understanding of how narcissistic vulnerability
interacts with different trauma themes.
The research questions include: Do individuals high in narcissistic vulnerability exhibit more intense PTSD
symptomatology (intrusive re-experiencing, avoidance, arousal) after ego-threatening (humiliation) trauma than
after physical assault? Are negative affect and dissociative symptoms more pronounced in such cases? Do
physiological stress markers (salivary cortisol, heart rate variability) show differential patterns for humiliation
versus assault in vulnerable narcissists? Answering these will elucidate psychological and neurobiological
pathways linking self-concept, trauma type, and posttraumatic response.
Literature Review
Narcissistic Vulnerability
Pathological narcissism is often measured by instruments like the Pathological Narcissism Inventory
(PNI) 8 . The PNI yields scales for grandiose and vulnerable features of narcissism 7 8 . Vulnerable
narcissism is characterized by fragility, hypersensitivity, and inner turmoil: individuals feel chronically
insecure, anxious about others’ evaluations, and prone to shame when self-esteem is threatened 1 2 .
Unlike overt grandiosity, this type of narcissism is often hidden; vulnerable individuals may oscillate
between self-criticism and fleeting grandiose fantasies 9 . Empirical studies note that vulnerable
narcissism correlates with depression, anxiety, hostility, and shame, especially following stress or perceived
failure 1 . Clinically, it manifests as unstable mood and affect dysregulation when confronted with ego
threats 2 .
In summary, vulnerable narcissists tend to have a fragile self that requires constant validation and reacts
strongly to any hint of criticism or rejection 1 2 . They may appear envious or self-pitying when
thwarted, and are more likely to collapse into shame than anger. This theoretical profile suggests they could
respond differently to social humiliation (targeting self-esteem) than to impersonal physical harm.
Trauma Types and Ego Threat
Traumatic events vary in their core nature. Many trauma studies differentiate interpersonal/relational
traumas (e.g., abuse, humiliation) from non-relational traumas (e.g., accidents, natural disasters) because
the former often entail violations of trust and self-concept. Posttraumatic embitterment is an example of a
reaction to singular events experienced as deeply unjust or humiliating 10 . Although not officially in
DSM-5, related constructs (like betrayal trauma or PTSD with prominent shame) have been discussed in the
literature.
2

Public humiliation is a severe ego-threat: one’s worst fears about worthlessness or disgrace may be realized.
Neuroscience suggests that social pain (shame, rejection) uses similar neural pathways as physical pain 10 .
The shame meta-analysis notes that shame activates threat-related processes akin to physical pain 5 , and
that trauma-related shame predicts PTSD symptoms and avoidance behaviors 10 . In comparison, physical
assault typically triggers classic fear circuits (fight-or-flight) and elicits PTSD mainly through memories of
life-threat, helplessness, or bodily harm. Both types can lead to PTSD, but humiliation may involve
additional self-related attributions (“I am worthless”) that uniquely drive symptoms.
Understanding how narcissistic vulnerability modulates these reactions is key. Ego-threat theory (e.g. social
self-preservation) suggests that threats to one’s social standing produce cortisol spikes and negative self-
evaluations 6 . Vulnerable narcissists, already on guard for ego challenges, might show especially strong
stress responses to humiliation, potentially resulting in more severe posttraumatic outcomes. In contrast,
they may perceive physical threat as devastating but not personally condemning, perhaps eliciting less
shame-driven dysregulation relative to humiliation. The specific psychological and biological mechanisms
linking these elements have not been fully tested.
PTSD Subtypes and Symptom Clusters
PTSD is heterogeneous. DSM-5 outlines symptom clusters (intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in
cognition/mood, arousal) and recognizes a dissociative subtype (persistent depersonalization/derealization)
in some sufferers. There are also proposed distinctions like “fear-based” vs. “anhedonic” PTSD, or
“externalizing” vs “internalizing” phenotypes, though these are not formal diagnoses. Social traumas often
co-occur with intense shame, guilt, or anger, which may alter the symptom profile (e.g., more negative
beliefs about self or others).
Dissociation is particularly relevant: a fraction of trauma survivors experience dissociative symptoms, and
this can worsen prognosis. People with PTSD tend to score high on the Dissociative Experiences Scale
(DES-II) 4 , which captures depersonalization, derealization, and amnesic experiences. Some theories
propose that dissociation is a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy; those unable to process shame/
trauma may disconnect from experience to cope. Narcissistic vulnerability might predispose to dissociation:
vulnerable narcissism has roots in trauma and unmet needs, possibly entwined with dissociative defenses
(Howell, 2003). Though empirical work is limited, we include the DES-II in anticipation that higher
dissociation will accompany intense humiliation in vulnerable narcissists, reflecting an extreme coping style
4 .
Ego-Threat and Social Self-Preservation Theory
The social self-preservation theory provides a framework for understanding how ego threats induce
stress responses. Dickerson and Kemeny (2004) describe a biologically-mediated “social self-preservation
system” that monitors threats to social esteem or status and triggers protective responses (increased
cortisol and self-conscious emotions) 6 . For example, controlled experiments have shown that tasks
involving public evaluation or rejection raise cortisol levels even when physical threat is absent. Threats to
the physical self (survival, injury) naturally activate stress biology, but important research indicates that
symbolic threats to one’s social standing can engage the same HPA axis.
In non-human primates, low-status animals chronically exhibit elevated cortisol under social subordination
6 . In humans, socially-evaluative stressors cause spikes in cortisol and negative self-reflection 6 . Thus,
3

a humiliating trauma recall – especially if described as “everyone laughed at me” or “I was publicly shamed”
– should provoke a strong neuroendocrine stress response. By contrast, a purely physical trauma may
provoke adrenaline and fear but perhaps less targeted negative self-cognitions. We integrate this theory to
predict physiological outcomes (cortisol, HRV) in our study.
Affective Dysregulation and Narcissism
Emotion regulation difficulties are well-documented in vulnerable narcissism. Research finds that higher
vulnerable narcissism is associated with greater emotion dysregulation and maladaptive coping strategies
2 . For instance, individuals with high narcissistic vulnerability score higher on measures of uncontrolled
anger, anxiety, and mood lability. They often externalize blame and struggle to tolerate criticism 9 11 .
Experiments indicate that vulnerable narcissists exhibit elevated negative affect when their self-view is
challenged. The present study will use the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson et al.,
1988) to quantify current emotional state after each recall. We expect those high in vulnerable narcissism to
report more negative affect and less positive affect following humiliation than others.
Dissociation
Building on earlier points, dissociation will be assessed via the DES-II, a widely-used self-report scale 4 .
We include it for two reasons. First, trauma-related dissociation often correlates with high PTSD severity.
Second, if vulnerable narcissists use dissociation to defend against intolerable shame or anger, this may be
most evident after humiliation. Prior literature notes that people with PTSD score high on dissociation
scales 4 , but few studies have considered narcissistic traits in this context. Including the DES-II allows
exploration of whether dissociation mediates the link between narcissistic vulnerability and PTSD
symptoms, especially in ego-threatening conditions.
Methodology
Design
This mixed-methods study combines quantitative and qualitative data. The core design is a 2×2 mixed
experiment: each participant is categorized by narcissistic vulnerability (high vs. low) and randomly
assigned to recall either a humiliation or a physical assault trauma. Quantitative outcomes (surveys,
physiological metrics) will be compared across conditions and traits. Additionally, semi-structured
interviews will qualitatively explore participants’ emotional responses and meaning-making.
Participants and Recruitment
We will recruit approximately 100 adult outpatient clients (e.g., from community mental health clinics) to
achieve sufficient power for medium effect sizes (α=0.05, power=0.80) in ANOVA/regression models.
Inclusion criteria: ages 18–65, fluent in English, and with a history of at least one significant ego-threatening
event and one physical assault (to ensure recall feasibility). Exclusion: current psychosis or severe cognitive
impairment (due to risk of distress and protocol comprehension), acute suicidality, and conditions
contraindicating study procedures (e.g., steroid medications affecting cortisol). We will actively seek a
diverse sample: balanced gender, various racial/ethnic backgrounds, and varied socioeconomic statuses,
reflecting the clinic population.

Measures
Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) – A 52-item self-report assessing grandiose and vulnerable
narcissism 8 . We will use the total vulnerable narcissism score as a continuous predictor and also create
high/low groups via median split for some analyses. The PNI has demonstrated reliability (α≈.90) and
validity for this trait 8 .
PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) – A 20-item self-report of PTSD symptoms over the past week 3 .
Administered after recall, the PCL-5 will capture intrusion, avoidance, negative mood, and arousal
symptoms related to the recalled event. Total score (0–80) will index PTSD severity 3 .
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) – A 20-item measure yielding positive affect and negative
affect scores (Watson et al., 1988). Participants rate current mood; high reliability. We will compare negative
affect (e.g., upset, ashamed) between trauma recall conditions, expecting more negative affect after
humiliation in vulnerable narcissists.
Dissociative Experiences Scale-II (DES-II) – A 28-item scale of dissociative experiences 4 . Participants
indicate how frequently they experience such phenomena. We expect higher scores after trauma recall,
particularly in the humiliation condition among high-vulnerability individuals 4 .
Physiological Measures: - Salivary Cortisol: Collected via passive drool at baseline (pre-recall), immediately
post-recall, and 30 minutes post-recall (to capture peak cortisol lag) 6 . Samples will be assayed for cortisol
concentration (μg/dL). Hypothesis: greater cortisol increase for humiliation recall in high-vulnerability
group. - Heart Rate Variability (HRV): Continuous ECG recorded (via chest strap) from 5 min before recall
through 10 min after. HRV indices (e.g., RMSSD) will be computed. Lower HRV reflects sympathetic
dominance/stress. We anticipate a larger HRV drop (stress response) during and after recall of humiliation
among vulnerable narcissists.
Additional Qualitative Interviews: After quantitative assessments, participants will be interviewed using
open-ended prompts about their recalled trauma, emotions, and coping. The interviews will be transcribed
and analyzed thematically to contextualize the quantitative findings, exploring how narcissistic self-views
shape trauma narratives.
Procedure
Participants will be scheduled for a lab session. After informed consent and baseline questionnaires
(demographics, PNI), each person will rest 5 minutes (for baseline physiology), then be randomly assigned
to one recall condition.
Trauma Recall Task: Using standardized instructions, participants will vividly recall and describe a personal
memory of severe public humiliation or physical assault (depending on condition). This will last ~5–10
minutes and is guided to ensure relevant content. Example prompts: “Please describe an event when you
felt deeply humiliated in front of others…” or “Describe a time you were physically assaulted and felt
threatened.” A clinician will gently probe for details. The task aims to elicit emotional recall (without real-
time social evaluation).
5

Immediately post-recall, self-report measures (PCL-5, PANAS, DES-II) will be completed regarding feelings
about the event. Physiological monitoring continues throughout the recall and 10-minute recovery. Cortisol
samples are taken pre-task, +30min post-task, as cortisol peaks roughly 20–30 min after stress 6 .
Data Collection Notes: Efforts will ensure minimal disruption (e.g., consistent time of day to control diurnal
cortisol), and we will provide breaks between tasks. Participants will also receive a debrief and access to
support resources.
Ethical Considerations
We will obtain IRB approval and follow APA ethical guidelines for trauma research. Key precautions include:
(1) Thorough informed consent explaining the stress nature of tasks. (2) Exclusion of individuals for whom
recall may be too destabilizing (e.g., extremely high suicide risk). (3) On-site mental health professional
standby, and immediate debriefing to contain any acute distress. (4) Participants may withdraw at any
point. (5) Confidentiality of sensitive trauma narratives will be protected rigorously.
Multicultural Considerations: Researchers will be trained in cultural competence. Recruitment will include
diverse populations, and we will ensure that recall prompts are culturally sensitive (e.g., acknowledging that
perceptions of humiliation may vary by social norms). If necessary, validated translations of measures (PNI,
PCL-5, DES-II) will be used for non-English speakers. We will analyze whether race/ethnicity or cultural
background moderates effects: for instance, in collectivist cultures, public shaming might carry even
heavier weight. Cultural factors (gender norms, stigma around shame) will be recorded and potentially
included as covariates.
Data Analysis Plan
Hypotheses: 1. PTSD Severity: High-vulnerability participants will have higher PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 scores)
after humiliation recall than after assault, whereas low-vulnerability individuals will show a smaller
difference (interaction effect). 2. Negative Affect: High-vulnerability × humiliation group will report highest
negative affect (PANAS-NA). 3. Dissociation: DES-II scores will be highest in the high-vulnerability/humiliation
condition. 4. Physiology: Cortisol increase (Δ from baseline) and HRV decrease (during recovery) will be larger
in the humiliation condition for vulnerable narcissists.
Statistical Analysis: We will conduct mixed ANOVAs with trauma type (between-subjects: humiliation vs
assault) and narcissism (continuous PNI scores or high/low) as factors predicting each outcome (PCL-5 total,
PANAS NA, DES-II, cortisol change, HRV metrics). Regression models will test PNI scores as predictor of
PTSD symptoms, with trauma type as moderator. We will correct for multiple comparisons (e.g., Bonferroni)
across dependent measures. Effect sizes (η², Cohen’s d) will be reported. Physiological data will be examined
with time-series or change scores (peak-baseline). We will also explore mediation: e.g., does negative affect
or dissociation mediate the link between narcissism and PTSD in humiliation?
Qualitative Analysis: Interview transcripts will be thematically coded (by at least two raters). We anticipate
themes related to self-worth, anger, and coping. For example, high-vulnerability individuals may frame
humiliation as confirming negative self-beliefs (shame narrative), whereas others focus on fear during
assault. These patterns will be integrated with survey data.

Anticipated Results
We hypothesize an interaction between narcissistic vulnerability and trauma type. Specifically, vulnerability is
expected to amplify PTSD symptoms predominantly in the humiliation condition. In a mixed ANOVA, this
would appear as a significant Narcissism×Trauma interaction on PCL-5 scores. Post-hoc contrasts might
show that high-vulnerability participants have much higher PCL-5 after humiliation (M_hum > M_assault),
whereas low-vulnerability participants show smaller difference or overall lower PCL-5 scores.
Parallel findings are expected for PANAS and DES-II. Vulnerable narcissists recalling humiliation will likely
endorse more negative emotions (“ashamed,” “sad,” “hostile”) and higher dissociation than when recalling
assault. A possible mechanism is that humiliation triggers intense shame (a highly dysregulated, self-
referential emotion), whereas assault may evoke fear but not engage the fragile self-schema as deeply. We
will test if PANAS-NA mediates the effect of narcissism on PTSD symptoms in the humiliation condition.
Physiologically, we anticipate that salivary cortisol will rise more sharply from baseline to 30 minutes post-
task for the humiliation recall in high-vulnerability individuals 6 . This would reflect that ego-threat
activated their HPA axis robustly. HRV is expected to drop (indicating sympathetic arousal) more in the
humiliation condition as well, especially during and after the recall period. We will analyze HRV change and
possibly latency of recovery. If results align with theory, they would confirm that social-evaluative stressors
provoke quantifiable stress responses in narcissistic individuals.
Qualitative data should enrich these findings. We expect vulnerable narcissists to express accounts heavy in
self-criticism and shame, possibly struggling to verbalize anger or sadness. In contrast, narratives of assault
might focus on external danger and fear. These thematic differences will help illustrate the distinct
posttraumatic processes. For example, coding might reveal a theme like “shame-confirming self-view” that
appears only in the humiliation/high-vulnerability group.
Statistical control for potential confounds (e.g., baseline stress levels, comorbid depression) will clarify the
unique contribution of narcissism. We will also compare effect sizes to gauge practical significance. If the
hypothesized effects are found (e.g., p<.05, η² ~ .10 for interactions), it would support our model. If not,
alternative explanations (e.g., all trauma equally distressing for narcissists) will be considered.
Discussion
Theoretical Implications
If vulnerable narcissism interacts with trauma type as predicted, this research would extend both narcissism
theory and PTSD models. It would suggest that ego-threatening traumas (social humiliations) are
especially pathogenic for individuals with fragile self-esteem. This aligns with social self-preservation theory
6 and shame-centered trauma frameworks 5 . We would also highlight that narcissistic vulnerability
functions as a trait vulnerability factor for PTSD, not merely a consequence of trauma. This bridges
personality and trauma literatures, consistent with findings in veterans 1 .
Our results could refine PTSD subtype conceptualizations. The distinction between humiliation-based vs
fear-based trauma responses may inform future diagnostics: perhaps envisioning a shame-dissociative
7

phenotype of PTSD more likely in narcissistic vulnerability. Such a subtype might benefit from different
treatment foci (e.g., self-compassion training) than fear-based PTSD.
At a psychological level, findings would underscore that traumatic stress is filtered through the lens of self-
concept. Two people can endure similar trauma but experience it differently based on personality. This
aligns with quotes from our precursor study: “events impact us in highly personal ways… filtered through
our own way of viewing ourselves” 1 . Empirical support for this view could motivate more integrative
personality assessment in trauma research.
Clinical Applications
Clinically, the study suggests that assessing vulnerable narcissism (e.g., via PNI) in trauma survivors may
identify those at risk of complicated PTSD. For instance, a patient who experienced workplace
embarrassment might develop more severe chronic PTSD if he has high narcissistic vulnerability.
Psychotherapists could then emphasize interventions addressing shame and self-esteem (e.g. Narrative
Exposure, Cognitive Restructuring of self-beliefs) alongside standard trauma processing.
Therapies that teach emotion regulation may be vital, since our data would likely show affect dysregulation
as a mediator. Techniques from dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) or acceptance and commitment therapy
(ACT) might help such clients tolerate the distress of ego threat. Compassion-focused therapy, in particular,
could counteract chronic self-criticism and shame by building self-compassion (as [14] suggests).
Additionally, recognizing dissociation as a coping mechanism could prompt grounding strategies during
trauma therapy.
Our physiological findings also have implications. If salivary cortisol reliably reflects the acute distress of
humiliation, therapists might use biofeedback or stress management to address the bodily aspect of
shame. Heart rate patterns could inform relaxation training (e.g., HRV biofeedback) to teach clients how to
engage the parasympathetic system when triggered by social threats.
Multicultural and Ethical Reflection
A strength of this work is its attention to culture. Narcissistic vulnerability may manifest differently across
cultural contexts; for example, collectivist cultures emphasize social harmony, so public humiliation might
even more deeply wound the social self. Conversely, in individualist cultures, personal achievement is
paramount, so assault (which limits autonomy) might be felt more personally. Our study will examine
cultural moderators to these patterns. Culturally adapting trauma narratives and respecting diverse shame/
taboo topics are critical.
Ethically, our design acknowledges the potential harm in trauma recall. By integrating immediate support
and voluntary participation, we aim to minimize risk. Data interpretation will also be sensitive: we will avoid
blaming individuals for their narcissistic vulnerability or implying it “causes” PTSD in a deterministic way.
Instead, we will view narcissistic traits as one factor among many that shape trauma response. We will also
consider participants’ right to respectful treatment and will avoid pathologizing cultural expressions of self-
esteem or shame.
8

Limitations and Future Directions
Several limitations deserve mention. First, the experimental recall method, while controlled, does not
replicate actual trauma. Memory bias or reconstruction could influence results. Second, the mixed inpatient-
outpatient sample may limit generalizability to the broader population. Third, cross-sectional measurement
(before-after recall) precludes long-term outcome data. Future research should follow up to see if these
acute reactions predict chronic PTSD or treatment response.
We also rely on self-report (PNI, PCL-5, DES-II), which could be influenced by defensiveness – especially in
narcissistic individuals. Triangulating with clinician interviews or implicit measures would strengthen
validity. Expanding beyond recall tasks, future designs could use longitudinal trauma exposure (for
example, in soldiers or disaster workers) to track how narcissistic traits affect PTSD development over time.
Finally, the interplay of narcissism with other personality factors (e.g., borderline features, depression)
merits exploration. Our focus on narcissism may oversimplify complex personalities; future models should
include broader trait assessments.
Conclusion
This dissertation proposes to examine the nuanced interplay between ego-related trauma and narcissistic
vulnerability in shaping PTSD outcomes. By combining psychological inventories, physiological markers,
and personal narratives, the research aims to provide a rich, multi-layered understanding of how a fragile
self-concept transforms traumatic events into profound distress. Should hypotheses be confirmed, the
findings will illuminate the “wounded god” – the narcissist whose hidden pain drives pathological responses
– and will suggest that trauma care must attend not only to what happened, but to the inner value system
of the one who suffered.

multicultural and ethical considerations as guided by best practices.
