University of Chicago Undergraduate Psychology
Curriculum
Year 1 (Freshman)
• Fundamentals of Psychology (PSYC 20000) – Survey course covering core domains 1 . Introduces
brain–behavior basics (sensation, perception, cognition, learning, motivation) and classic
experiments 1 . Students often use an introductory text (e.g. OpenStax Psychology) and learn that
all behavior is rooted in neural processes (sensation, memory, emotion, etc. are brain-based 2 ).
This course builds a conceptual foundation for later courses in cognition and neuroscience.
• Calculus I & II (MATH 13100/13200) – Required general-education sequence. Provides mathematical
foundations (limits, derivatives, integrals) and reasoning skills needed for statistical analysis 3 .
Mastery of calculus allows students to understand probability and change, which are essential for
PSYC 20250 (statistics) in later years 3 .
• Social Psychology (PSYC 20600) – Often taken early as a breadth requirement. Examines how
individuals think about, feel about, and relate to others 4 5 . Topics include social perception,
attitudes and persuasion, conformity, group processes, and political psychology 5 . Readings
typically include classic and modern social psychology studies, training students in causal inference
and critical analysis (skills that complement early statistics training).
• Liberal Arts Integration: First-year students also complete the College’s Core curriculum (Great
Books, writing, and quantitative reasoning). Courses in philosophy, ethics, and humanities sharpen
critical thinking and argumentative skills, underpinning later work on research ethics and theoretical
models (for example, PSYC 20200 will explicitly address IRB and ethical standards 6 ).
Year 2 (Sophomore)
• Statistical Concepts (PSYC 20250, formerly 20100) – Introductory statistics for psychology 7 .
Covers descriptive statistics, probability, sampling and estimation, and inferential tests (t‑tests, chi-
square, ANOVA) 7 8 . Key texts might include Agresti & Finlay or OpenIntro materials. Students
learn to compute and interpret p-values and confidence intervals, laying groundwork for all
empirical studies. (It is recommended students complete both calculus quarters before or alongside
this course 3 .)
• Research Methods (PSYC 20200) – Intensive methods and design course 6 . Teaches how to
formulate hypotheses, design experiments or surveys, collect data, and analyze results 6 9 .
Students complete case studies and draft IRB protocols, emphasizing quantitative and qualitative
techniques and ethical issues 6 . Core concepts include validity, reliability, experimental control,
and writing grant-style proposals (the course culminates in a mock research proposal) 9 . This
course integrates formal research training with previous statistics knowledge.
• Biological Psychology (PSYC 20300) – Introduction to neuroscience and behavior 10 . Covers
anatomy, physiology and chemistry of the brain and nervous system, and how these change with
experience 11 . Students study neural mechanisms of perception, attention, action, motivation, and
emotion 11 . Typical readings include chapters from Pinel’s Biopsychology or similar texts, and papers
1

on neural communication. This course often runs concurrently with an Introductory Biology or
Foundations of Neuroscience course (e.g. PSYC 24450 12 ) to integrate biological sciences with
behavior.
• Developmental Psychology (PSYC 20500) – Survey of cognitive and social development in childhood
13 . Focuses on infancy through early childhood, covering major theories (Piaget, Vygotsky, etc.) and
empirical findings about how children learn number concepts, moral reasoning, language, and social
behavior 13 . Readings include developmental texts (e.g. Berk) and classic studies (e.g. on
attachment, theory of mind). Students learn that early environments and experience shape later
cognition and behavior, a theme that connects biology, cognition, and education.
• Broad Requirements: By the end of year 2, majors complete the two-quarter calculus requirement
and usually finish the stats/methods sequence. Students may also begin electives like computer
programming (e.g. PSYC 23030: Python for Behavioral Sciences), which supports data analysis
skills, and continue core humanities courses (e.g. critical writing seminars, ethical reasoning) that
reinforce the ability to critique research.
Year 3 (Junior)
• Cognitive Psychology (PSYC 20400) – Fundamental course on human thinking 14 . Views the brain
as an information-processing system, covering categorization, attention, memory, language, and
decision-making 14 15 . Students explore classic models of memory (short-term, long-term,
working memory), problem-solving strategies, and biases. Readings often come from cognitive
textbooks (e.g. Sternberg, Goldstein) and research articles. By now students can apply research
methods to cognitive experiments and interpret findings statistically.
• Remaining Core Area (fourth breadth course) – If not already done, students take one more of the
five core areas (Biological, Social, Developmental, Cognitive, or Sensation/Perception) 16 . For
example, a junior might enroll in PSYC 20700 (Sensation & Perception) if still needed (see below) or
re-take any if prerequisites are now met. The goal is to complete four breadth courses by end of
junior year.
• Advanced Psychology Electives: The six required electives are typically taken in the last two years.
In junior year students might choose courses such as:
• PSYC 24450 (Foundations of Neuroscience) – Introduces neural cell anatomy, sensory/motor
pathways, and cognition from a neuroscience perspective 12 .
• PSYC 23800 (Learning & Memory) – Advanced seminar on theories of learning (classical/operant
conditioning, statistical learning) and memory (implicit vs. explicit, models of memory systems).
• Area seminars (e.g. PSYC 25500 Cognitive Aging, PSYC 25101 Decision Making) – Specialized
topics in cognition or social behavior.
Electives deepen knowledge of subfields (e.g. psychopathology, communication, computational
models) and often include primary research articles.
• Research Experience: Juniors are strongly encouraged to conduct independent research 17 . Many
take PSYC 29700/29200 (Undergrad Research/Reading) or enroll in lab courses, gaining hands-on
methodology skills. In parallel they may take advanced statistics (e.g. regression, longitudinal
methods) to handle real data. Research participation integrates all prior learning (design, ethics,
analysis) and often leads to an honors project.

Year 4 (Senior)
• Senior Seminar / Honors Thesis (PSYC 29800) – Honors-track students take the senior seminar in
Winter of their fourth year 18 . This course focuses on formulating, conducting, and writing up an
original research project. Students refine hypotheses, apply advanced statistical methods, and
prepare a written thesis under a faculty advisor. Senior spring features an Honors Day presentation
of the thesis findings 18 . Non-honors students may instead take an independent study or capstone
course, but all seniors integrate their cumulative knowledge through a major project.
• Capstone Electives: Remaining electives are taken. Examples include:
• PSYC 23800: Learning & Memory (if not already taken), covering models like dual-store memory
and neural substrates of learning.
• PSYC 23660: The Disordered Mind – Seminar on classification and causation of mental disorders
19 . Integrates biological, psychological, and social perspectives on disorders (e.g. depression,
schizophrenia, developmental disorders) 19 .
• Electives in any area (e.g. social cognition, applied psychology, ethics in science). These advanced
courses involve reading cutting-edge research and synthesizing models from previous courses.
• Integration of Knowledge: By senior year students have a clear, detailed “mental model” of
psychology. They can trace a behavior from sensory input (Sensation/Perception) through cognitive
processing (Cognitive Psych) to social influence (Social Psych), all measured with sound methods and
statistics. Their senior work explicitly combines earlier tools: designing experiments (Methods),
analyzing data (Statistics), and situating results in broader ethical and theoretical context
(Humanities). The result is a cohesive foundation for a future psychologist or researcher.
Sources: The UChicago psychology major requires research methods and statistics by year 3, four of five
core-area courses (20300–20700), and six additional electives 20 21 . Course descriptions and learning
goals are drawn from the department catalog and standard texts 21 22 . Core concepts (e.g. neural bases
