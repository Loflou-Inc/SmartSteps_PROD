Early Trauma and Giftedness in Context
Jane’s early years (ages 0–6) can plausibly include both exposure to family conflict and emerging giftedness.
Research shows that children exposed to high parental conflict or domestic violence often develop trauma
symptoms. For example, children in high-conflict divorced families frequently exhibit post-traumatic stress
symptoms 1 . Chronic exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) has been linked to worse child
outcomes: a meta-analysis found that greater IPV exposure predicted poorer emotional/behavioral
adjustment in children 2 . In such homes, children may also face polyvictimization (co-occurring abuse and
stressors), which further raises PTSD risk 3 4 . Notably, in the 1970s domestic violence was widely
regarded as a “private matter,” so few legal or social supports existed for affected families 5 6 . The
combination of verbal threats and actual violence could easily overwhelm a young child’s coping abilities
during that era.
• Increased PTSD risk: Children in chronically conflictual homes often develop PTSD-like symptoms or
anxiety 1 3 .
• Cumulative trauma: When domestic conflict coincides with other stressors (e.g. moving, divorce,
abuse), children show especially high trauma symptoms 3 4 .
• Chronic hyperarousal: Witnessing threats can lead to persistent hypervigilance. Neuroscience
studies find that even infants exposed to parental violence develop hypervigilant error-monitoring
by age 8 7 . PTSD’s core features (chronic hyperarousal and vigilance) can persist long after the
violence ends 8 .
Giftedness Amid Instability
Simultaneously, Jane could exhibit early signs of giftedness. Gifted children often reach cognitive milestones
ahead of peers. For example, profoundly gifted toddlers commonly learn to read, write, and do simple math
“years before their peers” 9 . They require intellectual stimulation even as infants 10 , asking endless
“why” questions and remembering complex facts. Gifted children also tend to be ...

Northwestern University (Feinberg) M.A. in
Clinical Psychology (2-Year Program)
The Clinical Psychology M.A. at Northwestern’s Feinberg School of Medicine is an intensive 8-quarter, two-
year full-time program 1 . It follows the scientist–practitioner model: students complete rigorous
coursework in clinical theory, assessment, ethics, multicultural psychology, and research methods, while
simultaneously engaging in supervised clinical practicum and laboratory research. The program’s
stated aims include developing foundational competencies in research design, analytics, and ethics 2 and
integrating clinical science with practice. In practice, this means Year 1 emphasizes core theories and skills
(psychotherapy models, assessment, diversity, lifespan development) and Year 2 deepens advanced
intervention, systems theory, and scientific foundations, all under close faculty supervision. By the end of
Year 2, students have accumulated ~700 total practicum hours (≥280 direct client hours) 3 and a broad
academic foundation, positioning them for doctoral-level study and clinical work.
Year 1
Fall Quarter (Year 1)
Courses: The Fall quarter includes three core 1-unit courses 4 : Introduction to Psychotherapy, Psychological
Assessment I, and Diversity in Psychological Science and Practice. Together these classes establish basic
psychotherapy skills, assessment knowledge, and cultural competence.
• Introduction to Psychotherapy (1 unit): Covers major theory-based models of counseling (e.g.
psychodynamic, behavioral-cognitive, humanistic, family systems) and teaches foundational skills
(active listening, empathy, case conceptualization). Students learn the common factors of therapy
and practice basic techniques (rapport-building, basic interviewing) via role-play and supervised
exercises. The course also explicitly addresses how cultural, contextual, and individual differences
impact therapy 5 . (Representative texts: Corey’s Theory and Practice of Counseling; the APA

Simulating an APA-Accredited CMHC Psychology
Internship in NW Ohio
Figure: In a typical rural CMHC therapy session, interns balance active listening with careful note-taking (photo
from a therapy setting). Internships are full-time (usually 2000–2080 hours/year, ~40–42.5 hr/week) 1 . Ohio
law requires at least 25% of placement time in face-to-face client contact and 1 hour of individual
supervision per 20 hours worked 2 . In practice my weekly schedule is roughly:
• Direct clinical services (~15–20 hrs/week): Individual and group therapy (treating depression,
anxiety, PTSD, etc.), about 75% of training time 3 .
• Psychological assessment (~3–5 hrs): Administering/intake testing (cognitive or personality
measures) and report writing for complex cases.
• Supervision (~3–4 hrs): Typically 2 hrs individual (meeting Ohio’s 1:20 rule 2 ) plus 1–2 hrs group
supervision/case conference 2 4 . Supervisors are licensed psychologists (PhD/PsyD) on site 5 .
• Didactics & seminars (~1–2 hrs): Weekly staff meetings and workshops (e.g. ethics, evidence-based
treatments). Interns “learn to apply… professional ethics and standards” through these cases and
seminars 6 .
• Case management & admin (~5–10 hrs): Progress notes, care coordination (schools, hospitals),
paperwork and client follow-ups.
• Licensure prep (~1–2 hrs): Self-study or group review for the national EPPP and Ohio’s
jurisprudence exam (covering ethics and law).
These components align with APA and state training rules: for example, Ohio mandates additional group/
case-conference time (≥1 hr/week beyond individual supervision) 7 and at least one licensed psychologist
on-site as primary supervisor 5 .

================================================================================

University of Chicago Undergraduate Psychology
Curriculum
Year 1 (Freshman)
• Fundamentals of Psychology (PSYC 20000) – Survey course covering core domains 1 . Introduces
brain–behavior basics (sensation, perception, cognition, learning, motivation) and classic
experiments 1 . Students often use an introductory text (e.g. OpenStax Psychology) and learn that
all behavior is rooted in neural processes (sensation, memory, emotion, etc. are brain-based 2 ).
This course builds a conceptual foundation for later courses in cognition and neuroscience.
• Calculus I & II (MATH 13100/13200) – Required general-education sequence. Provides mathematical
foundations (limits, derivatives, integrals) and reasoning skills needed for statistical analysis 3 .
Mastery of calculus allows students to understand probability and change, which are essential for
PSYC 20250 (statistics) in later years 3 .
• Social Psychology (PSYC 20600) – Often taken early as a breadth requirement. Examines how
individuals think about, feel about, and relate to others 4 5 . Topics include social perception,
attitudes and persuasion, conformity, group processes, and political psychology 5 . Readings
typically include classic and modern social psychology studies, training students in causal inference
and critical analysis (skills that complement early statistics training).
• Liberal Arts Integration: First-year students also complete the College’s Core curriculum (Great
Books, writing, and quantitative reasoning). Courses in philosophy, ethics, and humanities sharpen
critical thinking and argumentative skills, underpinning later work on research ethics and theoretical
models (for example, PSYC 20200 will explicitly address IRB and ethical standards 6 ).
Year 2 (Sophomore)
• Statistical Concepts (PSYC 20250, formerly 20100) – Introductory statistics for psychology 7 .
Covers descriptive statistics, probability, sampling and estimation, and inferential tests (t‑tests, chi-
square, ANOVA) 7 8 . Key texts might inc...

Wounded Gods: Narcissistic Vulnerability and
PTSD Symptomatology Following Ego-Threatening
Trauma
Abstract
This proposed dissertation examines how individuals high in vulnerable narcissism respond to ego-
threatening versus physically threatening traumatic memories. Vulnerable narcissism – a personality style
marked by hypersensitivity, shame-proneness, and fragile self-worth – has been linked to more severe PTSD
symptoms after trauma 1 2 . However, its interaction with different trauma types (e.g. social humiliation
vs. physical assault) is not well understood. Using a mixed-methods design with outpatient clients,
participants will complete the Pathological Narcissism Inventory (PNI) to quantify vulnerability, then be
randomly prompted to recall either a profound episode of public humiliation or physical assault. Outcome
measures include PTSD symptoms (via the PCL-5) 3 , affect (PANAS), dissociative experiences (DES-II) 4 ,
and physiological stress markers (salivary cortisol and heart rate variability). It is hypothesized that high-
vulnerability individuals will exhibit greater PTSD symptom severity, negative affect, and physiological stress
when recalling humiliation than assault, compared to lower-vulnerability peers. Qualitative interviews will
explore personal meaning and emotion regulation. Anticipated findings would support theories that ego
threats (social status losses) provoke intense shame and stress responses similar to physical danger 5
6 . Clinical implications include screening for narcissistic vulnerability in trauma survivors and tailoring
interventions (e.g., shame-focused therapies, compassion-based strategies) for those with injury to self-
esteem. The study will carefully integrate multicultural perspectives (e.g., varying cultural norms of honor
and shame) and rigorous ethical safeguards (informed consent, emotional support) in its design and
interpretation.

Pathological narcissism comprises two interwoven themes: grandiosity (inf...

================================================================================

Jane’s Adolescent Trauma and Identity Formation
Effects of Early Trauma on Adolescent Behavior
• Substance Use: Research shows abused adolescents are far more likely to misuse drugs or alcohol.
For example, in one national survey teens who experienced physical or sexual abuse were roughly
three times more likely to report substance abuse than non‑traumatized peers 1 . Likewise, up to
59% of youth with PTSD (post‑traumatic stress disorder) go on to develop substance problems 1 .
These findings suggest Jane’s history of threats and abuse could plausibly lead her to self‑medicate
or experiment with drugs/alcohol in her teens.
• Risk-Taking Behaviors: Adolescents with maltreatment histories tend to engage in more risky
behaviors overall. In a study of 470 South African teens, those reporting childhood trauma had
significantly higher levels of risk-taking and self-harm than those without trauma (t(468)=3.409, p<.
001) 2 . Such behaviors include running away, unsafe sex, delinquency or other thrill-seeking. Given
Jane’s chaotic home life, her turning to high-risk activities or rebellious actions in adolescence would
be consistent with the empirical link between early abuse and teen risk-taking 2 .
• Emotional Dysregulation: Maltreatment disrupts normal emotion regulation. McLaughlin et al.
(2016) found that child abuse exposure predicts heightened emotional reactivity and more
impulsive responses to distress in teens 3 . In other words, trauma-exposed adolescents have
faster, stronger emotional responses and resort to rumination or impulsive coping (anger outbursts,
self-injury) when upset 3 . Jane’s volatile feelings, mood swings, or difficulty calming herself would
fit this pattern of dysregulated emotion linked to early abuse.
Trauma and Sexual Identity Formation
• High Trauma Prevalence in LGBTQ Youth: Epidemiological studies consistently find that lesbians
and bisexual women report much higher rates of childhood maltreatment than heterosexuals 4 .
For example, one la...

Jane’s Journal: Clinical Psychologist (Ages 43–46)
Jane arrived at Northwest Ohio Psychiatric Hospital (NOPH) in the fall of her 43rd year. In the writing of her
clinical diary, she notes how sharply Ohio’s behavioral health demand outstripped provider supply 1 . By
dawn she’s already reviewing a stack of case charts in a drafty conference room, aware that understaffing
has pushed caseloads to unsustainable levels 1 . Her first patient session of the day often involves a
complex trauma case or severe personality disorder – the very clients she trained for, yet she feels weighed
down by the “vicious cycle” of too few therapists and too many patients 1 . By lunchtime she can feel the
textbook “cognitive overload” setting in 2 : chart details blur and she has to double-check basic facts. Late
afternoons bring mandated paperwork and team meetings, where she confronts the reality that nearly half
of her profession quietly suffers burnout 3 . (Some days she recognizes in herself the creeping cynicism
described in burnout literature: a detachment that makes her guidance feel generic 4 . She fights it,
reminding herself that meaning still exists in this work.)
• Morning rounds and chart review. Each day begins with a huddle to triage emergencies, often on
auto-pilot. The hospital’s halls are stained by old paint and poor ventilation – a subtle reminder of
budget cuts.
• Therapy and medication management. By mid-morning Jane conducts 3–4 individual therapy
sessions (CBT or psychodynamic, depending on the client), then joins a psychiatrist to adjust meds.
The large caseload means brief 30-minute sessions in small, sterile rooms.
• Multidisciplinary conferences. Weekly case conferences involve social workers, nurses, and
psychiatrists. Jane often plays devil’s advocate, noting how patients’ background trauma feeds their
pathology. These meetings reveal systemic strain: one colleague confessed the hospital had eight
open therapist positions but barely one applicant in weeks 1 ....

Jane’s Middle Childhood (Ages 7–12): Trauma and
Coping
Sexual Abuse by a Stepparent: Effects and Dynamics
• Children sexually abused by a parent or stepparent often suffer severe, long-term trauma. Studies
link such abuse to chronic PTSD symptoms, depression, anxiety, low self-esteem and later substance
problems 1 . Abuse by a family member (incest) typically produces worse outcomes than abuse by
outsiders 2 . For example, victims of father-daughter or stepfather-stepdaughter incest report
feeling deeply “damaged,” with persistent guilt, shame, worthlessness and interpersonal problems
3 1 .
• Intrafamilial abuse is marked by secrecy and betrayal. Courtois and Kluft note that incest survivors
almost always experience secrecy, conflicted loyalty, powerlessness and fear of reprisal 4 . The
average incestuous abuse in families lasts years; prolonged abuse (especially beginning in early
childhood) typically leads to avoidant coping and dissociative defenses 5 . In Jane’s case, a hidden,
long-term sexual betrayal by a trusted stepfather would likely induce severe trauma bonding and
avoidance – the child may unconsciously dissociate or “freeze” during abuse 5 6 .
• The family’s response often compounds the harm. Research reports that mothers sometimes
disbelieve children who accuse a stepfather 7 , and communities in that era were often reluctant to
discuss child sex abuse. Betrayal trauma theory predicts a child will stay silent if disclosure could
jeopardize the family or if authorities are dismissive. As a result, Jane likely learned to keep the abuse
secret, deepening her isolation and self-blame 4 7 .
Dissociation and Trauma in Children
• Dissociation as a defense: Traumatized children frequently use dissociation to cope. When an event
becomes overwhelming, a child may mentally detach – feeling as though onlookers, “on the ceiling,”
or in a dream rather than fully present 6 . This protects them from unbearable fear or pain. In
complex or repeated abuse, dissociation c...
