Northwestern Feinberg School of Medicine –
Clinical Psychology PhD Curriculum (Years 1–4)
Figure: Official program timeline for Northwestern’s Clinical Psychology PhD (years 1–5), showing coursework,
research, and practicum milestones. By design, Year 1 emphasizes foundational science and clinical methods,
Year 2 adds advanced courses and the first practicum, and Years 3–4 emphasize specialization and independent
research 1 2 .
Year 1: Foundations in Science and Practice
• Courses: Students complete ~12 credits (3–4 courses/quarter) covering core scientific and clinical
content 3 . Required classes include the Assessment sequence (Psych. Assessment I–III),
Psychopathology, Introduction to Psychotherapy, Diversity in Psychological Science & Practice,
Scientific & Professional Ethics, plus advanced research/statistics (Research Methods I–III,
Advanced Design). In addition, they take foundational discipline courses in cognition, emotion,
development and neurobiology (e.g. Cognitive Psychology, Behavioral Neuroscience, Life-Span
Developmental Psychology) 4 .
• Core Concepts & Theories: The curriculum covers the major paradigms of psychology. In
assessment courses, students learn standardized testing of intelligence, memory and achievement
(e.g. WAIS/WISC administration) and report writing 5 . Psychopathology courses survey DSM-5
diagnostic criteria for mood, anxiety, psychotic and other disorders and their etiological models 6 .
Students are introduced to major intervention models (CBT, psychodynamic, family systems, etc.) in
Introduction to Psychotherapy. Simultaneously, cognitive-affective models and basic neuroscience
1

(e.g. brain–behavior relationships) are learned in discipline-specific classes, integrating biological,
cognitive and developmental perspectives 4 6 .
• Key Readings/Textbooks: Core texts typically include the DSM-5 (APA, 2013) for diagnosis, Sattler’s
Assessment of Children or Groth-Marnat’s Handbook of Psychological Assessment for testing, standard
abnormal psychology texts (e.g. Comer’s Abnormal Psychology), and psychotherapy theory primers
(e.g. Corey’s Theory and Practice of Psychotherapy). Statistics and research methods are supported by
texts like Rumsey’s Statistics for Psychology or Maxwell’s Designing Experiments. (These are illustrative
examples of top-tier materials used in such courses.)
• Clinical Practicum: Training begins immediately. In summer of Year 1 (July onward) students start
an introductory practicum (5–10 hours/week) under licensed supervision 7 . Typical first-year
placements are within Northwestern’s system – e.g. observation/assessment practicums at
Northwestern Medicine’s Adult Psychiatry clinic or at Lurie Children’s testing service 8 7 . The goal
is orientation: students begin taking brief histories and observing intake evaluations under
supervision.
• Ethics & Multicultural Integration: Ethical principles and cultural competence are introduced
explicitly via the required Ethics and Diversity courses 9 10 . From the start, students discuss
confidentiality, informed consent, and culture (race, gender, etc.) in both research and clinical
settings, setting a framework that guides all clinical interactions and research design.
• Competency Goals: By year’s end, students have built a broad knowledge base – they can conduct
basic psychological tests, formulate DSM-based diagnoses, and understand major treatment
models. They also have the statistical and research-design skills to begin contributing in a lab 1
3 . This foundation supports all future learning.
Year 2: Advanced Coursework and First Practicum
• Courses: In Year 2 students register ~9–12 credits, shifting focus to applied and elective courses 11 .
A required class is Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CLIN_PSY 444), which teaches CBT theory, case
formulation, and interventions (e.g. cognitive restructuring, exposure) across disorders 12 .
Remaining credits come from discipline-specific and elective offerings. For example, students might
take advanced psychological assessment (CLIN_PSY 404, focusing on clinical interviews and
personality measures) 13 or start an elective in their track (e.g. Behavioral Neuroscience if not yet
taken, or Advanced Research Methodology). Additional electives (ACT, DBT, family therapy, etc.) can be
taken if workload permits.
• Core Concepts: Year 2 deepens clinical knowledge. The CBT course immerses students in cognitive
theory (Beck’s model, cognitive distortions) and behavioral principles (learning theory, activation
strategies) 12 . Assessment training continues with integration of data (projective tests, structured
interviews) and cultural considerations 13 . Students also begin developing research skills (e.g.
advanced statistics or data analysis techniques) to support their Research Qualifying Paper.
• Key Readings/Textbooks: Examples include Beck’s Cognitive Therapy of Depression or Treatment Plans
and Interventions for Depression in CBT courses, and Sattler/Groth-Marnat for advanced assessment.
The SCID interview guide (First et al.) is often used for diagnostic practice. Research methods
readings (e.g. textbooks on multiple regression, experimental design) accompany lab work.
• Clinical Practicum: Year 2 marks the first full-year practicum (15–20+ hours/week) 14 .
Placements are assigned by Major Area of Study: e.g. Adult-track students may be at Northwestern’s
outpatient psychiatric clinic; Child-track students at Lurie Children’s neuropsych testing service;
Neuropsychology-track students at the NMG Neuropsychology clinic 8 14 . Under weekly
individual supervision (plus group seminars), students conduct intakes, testing batteries, and short-
2

term therapy as appropriate. This hands-on training builds practical skills in assessment and basic
therapy under close mentorship.
• Ethics & Multicultural: The issues raised in Year 1 courses are now applied in practice. In practicum,
students face real ethical choices (e.g. confidentiality, dual relationships) and must consider clients’
cultural backgrounds in case conceptualization. Supervisors emphasize cultural humility and ethical
decision-making in case discussions.
• Competency Goals: By end of Year 2, students have begun to integrate science and practice. They
can administer and interpret several psychological tests, do diagnostic interviewing, and conduct
CBT-informed therapy under supervision. They also have engaged in original research design – by
this point they begin their Research Qualifying Paper (an empirical study with mentor support) 15 .
This year prepares them for greater independence: managing a caseload (~1–2 therapy cases) while
writing and analyzing a modest research project.
Year 3: Specialization and Advanced Skills
• Courses: Students register another 9–12 credits, choosing remaining required and elective courses
16 . By Year 3 most core requirements are done, so coursework is largely electives aligned with
students’ Major Area. Typical offerings include: Advanced Psychotherapy models (e.g. Dialectical
Behavior Therapy CLIN_PSY 447 17 , Acceptance & Commitment Therapy CLIN_PSY 446 18 ), Family
Therapy (CLIN_PSY 432), Sexual Disorders & Couple Therapy (CLIN_PSY 442) 19 , Child/Adolescent
Psychotherapy or Child Psychopathology (for Child track) 20 , Neuropsychology (Principles of
Neuroimaging CLIN_PSY 471; Neuropsych Assessment 475) 21 22 , Behavioral Medicine/Health
Psychology (CLIN_PSY 476–478) 23 , Forensic Psychology (CLIN_PSY 483) 24 , etc. Electives can also
include advanced statistics or seminar courses (e.g. Diversity or Social Psychology seminars).
Students tailor this year to their interests and intended specialty.
• Specialization Tracks: By Year 3 each student has declared a Major Area of Study (Adult, Child,
Neuropsychology, Forensic, or Behavioral Medicine) 25 . Electives and practica match this track. For
example, a Clinical Adult student might focus on trauma or couples: Northwestern has a Child
Trauma Center that doctoral students can rotate through, and the Sexual Disorders & Couple Therapy
course covers marital/sexual issues 19 . A Health/Behavioral Medicine student would take Health
Psychology (CLIN_PSY 476) and Motivation & Self-Control in Health Behavior (477) 23 . A
Neuropsychology student enrolls in Brain & Behavior: Intro to Neuropsychology (472) and
Neuroanatomy (473). Thus by mid-program students develop deep expertise (e.g. specialized
intervention models, developmental psychopathology, medical neuro, etc.) within their chosen
niche.
• Key Readings/Textbooks: Specialized courses use advanced texts: e.g. Linehan’s DBT Skills Training
Manual for DBT, Hayes’s ACT: An Experiential Approach for ACT, Nichols & Schwartz’s Family Therapy for
systems work, Mash & Barkley’s Child Psychopathology for child disorders, Lezak’s Neuropsychological
Assessment for neuro track, and primary literature (e.g. NIH “Clinical Practice Guidelines” for couples
therapy). Again, exact readings depend on instructor.
• Clinical Practicum: This is the second year-long practicum (15–20+ hrs/week) 14 . Placements
become more specialized: examples include VA medical centers, hospital inpatient units, outpatient
specialty clinics (depression/anxiety, pediatric rehab, etc.) or prison/forensic settings 26 . Students
carry more complex cases (often their own therapy case load and test batteries) and must
demonstrate integrated skills. Supervision remains weekly (individual and group), but students are
expected to take increasing initiative in case formulation and treatment planning.
3

• Ethics & Multicultural: Ethical decision-making and cultural considerations become second-nature.
For instance, when treating diverse populations (e.g. working with non-English-speaking clients or
clients from different religious backgrounds), students apply multicultural frameworks learned
earlier. All faculty mentors and supervisors emphasize culturally informed practice and research
ethics in ongoing seminars and case conferences.
• Competency Goals: By the end of Year 3 students must pass the Clinical Qualifying Exam
(demonstrating mastery of clinical theory, ethics, and case judgment) and complete the Research
Qualifying Paper 27 . This reflects integrated competency: they have shown independent case
conceptualization skills, applied interventions, and published or near-publishable empirical work. In
sum, Year 3 consolidates knowledge across domains (biological, cognitive, social, developmental)
and starts launching students into autonomous researcher- and clinician-level roles.
Year 4: Advanced Practicum, Research, and Teaching
• Courses: Few formal classes remain. Students typically enroll in Advanced Study/Research credit
(TGS 500/590) while focusing on dissertation research 28 . Any remaining elective requirements (if
any) are finished, but most coursework is complete by Year 3. At most, students might take a
seminar or two if needed for professional development, but the emphasis is on independent work.
• Research: The primary focus is the dissertation. By the end of Year 4 the dissertation proposal must
be defended 29 . Students often continue contributing to publications and seek external funding
(e.g. NIH F31). Approximately 20–30 hours/week remain in the research lab as students transition to
project leadership 2 .
• Clinical Practicum: This is the third (sometimes fourth) year-long practicum, with even greater
responsibility 30 . Placements are “advanced” — for example, as lead therapist in a specialty
program or senior diagnostician in neuropsych. Students manage more challenging cases with
greater autonomy (e.g. conducting long-term therapy, comprehensive neuropsych evaluations)
under supervisory oversight. A typical commitment remains ~15–20 hours/week 14 . This advanced
training ensures that students are ready to assume full responsibility on internship.
• Teaching Experience: In accordance with Northwestern policy, each student serves as a Teaching
Assistant for one quarter in Year 4 31 32 . This involves lecturing and leading discussion/lab
sections for courses taught to first-year students (often research methods or statistics). Through
teaching, students reinforce their grasp of foundational material and gain pedagogical skills.
• Ethics & Multicultural: By Year 4, ethical and cultural considerations inform all activities. Students
now mentor junior clinicians, ensuring they model confidentiality and cultural humility. In research,
they address ethics of human subjects (IRB procedures) and issues like justice (e.g. designing studies
with diverse samples). Continual reflection on multicultural competence (a focus of the diversity
seminar) is expected in leadership roles.
• Competency Goals: Year 4 cements the transition from trainee to independent clinical scientist.
Students complete their dissertation proposal and continue advanced research, demonstrating
scholarly independence 29 . Clinically, the advanced practicum and TA role show that they can
function as entry-level psychologists: diagnosing and treating patients across populations,
supervising others informally, and teaching peers. This sets the stage for Year 5–6 internship, where
they will apply their fully integrated competencies in practice.
