Simulating an APA-Accredited CMHC Psychology
Internship in NW Ohio
Figure: In a typical rural CMHC therapy session, interns balance active listening with careful note-taking (photo
from a therapy setting). Internships are full-time (usually 2000–2080 hours/year, ~40–42.5 hr/week) 1 . Ohio
law requires at least 25% of placement time in face-to-face client contact and 1 hour of individual
supervision per 20 hours worked 2 . In practice my weekly schedule is roughly:
• Direct clinical services (~15–20 hrs/week): Individual and group therapy (treating depression,
anxiety, PTSD, etc.), about 75% of training time 3 .
• Psychological assessment (~3–5 hrs): Administering/intake testing (cognitive or personality
measures) and report writing for complex cases.
• Supervision (~3–4 hrs): Typically 2 hrs individual (meeting Ohio’s 1:20 rule 2 ) plus 1–2 hrs group
supervision/case conference 2 4 . Supervisors are licensed psychologists (PhD/PsyD) on site 5 .
• Didactics & seminars (~1–2 hrs): Weekly staff meetings and workshops (e.g. ethics, evidence-based
treatments). Interns “learn to apply… professional ethics and standards” through these cases and
seminars 6 .
• Case management & admin (~5–10 hrs): Progress notes, care coordination (schools, hospitals),
paperwork and client follow-ups.
• Licensure prep (~1–2 hrs): Self-study or group review for the national EPPP and Ohio’s
jurisprudence exam (covering ethics and law).
These components align with APA and state training rules: for example, Ohio mandates additional group/
case-conference time (≥1 hr/week beyond individual supervision) 7 and at least one licensed psychologist
on-site as primary supervisor 5 .

Client Populations and Presenting Issues
NW Ohio CMHCs serve a diverse rural/suburban mix. Most clients are adults (often 25–64) who are low-
income or uninsured, with Medicaid covering many. Common populations include:
- Adults with mood/anxiety disorders: Depression and generalized anxiety are prevalent. (Local data show
~15% of surveyed adults had 2+ weeks of hopelessness in the past year 8 .) Many struggle with chronic
stress or trauma.
- Severe mental illness (SPMI): A substantial portion have schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
bipolar disorder. State reports note that rural CMHCs prioritize SPMI adults and severely emotionally
disturbed (SED) youth 9 .
- Substance use disorders: Opioid and alcohol dependence are common, often with co-occurring mental
health issues. For example, local CMHCs (e.g. Recovery Services of NW Ohio) specialize in dual-diagnosis
cases 10 .
- Trauma survivors: Many clients have histories of abuse, domestic violence, or combat exposure. Rural
northwest Ohio counties have some of the state’s highest suicide rates 11 , reflecting high trauma and
stress levels. Interns regularly encounter PTSD and grief work.
- Youth and family cases: Adolescents with anxiety, ADHD, or behavioral issues (SED) come through youth
teams or schools. Older adults with late-life depression, memory problems, or caregiving stress are also
seen.
- Underserved groups: These include rural elderly (frailty, isolation), migrants/farmworkers (often Hispanic
or Amish communities), and minority clients. Statewide, about 57% of public mental health clients are
White, with significant Black (17%) and Hispanic (15%) minorities 12 . In Toledo/Surrounding areas, interns
also see urban poverty and cultural diversity.
These populations bring a broad range of diagnoses (major depression, anxiety disorders, PTSD, bipolar,
schizophrenia, personality disorders, ADHD, etc.) and social stressors (poverty, job loss, legal issues). For
instance, in Lucas County 4% of adults reported seriously considering suicide in the past year 8 , so
assessing risk and safety planning are common tasks.
Supervision and Training Structure
The internship follows APA and Ohio licensing requirements closely. We have two primary supervisors
(licensed psychologists with ≥2 years post-licensure) as required 13 . Typically:
• Individual Supervision (2 hrs/week): One-on-one meetings to review cases, diagnostics, and
therapy skills. Ohio mandates ≥1 hr per 20 clinical hours 2 . In my setting I consistently get 2 hours
weekly.
• Group Supervision (~1–2 hrs/week): A multidisciplinary case conference or group supervision with
peers. This covers group cases, case conceptualization, and peer teaching. Ohio law explicitly
requires at least 1 additional hour of such learning activities per week 7 .
• Live Observation/Co-Therapy: Periodically, supervisors sit in on therapy or review recorded
sessions. For example, I once had a session observed for immediate feedback. Training models
emphasize “live observation by a supervisor” as part of learning 14 .
• Supervisor Credentials: All supervision is provided by licensed doctoral psychologists. Ohio rules
insist on a licensed psychologist on-site as primary supervisor 5 . By regulation, ≥75% of
2

supervision hours must come from psychologists (others like social workers cannot provide majority
supervision) 15 .
In addition, there are regular staff meetings, ethics case reviews, and informal mentoring. Interns also co-
lead community outreach or group therapy (with supervision), expanding skills. Our program values
feedback – for example, after a family therapy video session, my supervisor gave an hour of focused
coaching.
EPPP and Ethics Preparation
Preparing for licensure exams is integrated into the year. Interns cover professional ethics throughout the
training. We have a seminar series on the APA Ethics Code (confidentiality, dual relationships, mandatory
reporting, etc.), reflecting the APA goal that interns “learn to apply… professional ethics and standards” 6 .
Ethical scenarios (e.g. rural dual-role conflicts or telehealth consent issues) are discussed in supervision.
For the EPPP, many interns form study groups in late spring. The EPPP heavily tests ethics/legal standards
as part of its content, so our case conferences and didactics reinforce state laws (e.g. competency statutes)
and Ohio’s required jurisprudence exam topics. Though not always formally scheduled, supervisors
encourage reading APA’s ethics and Ohio Board materials. For example, one of my peers ran a weekly quiz
night on EPPP questions. In short, the internship embeds ethics (as above) and promotes self-study for
licensure testing.
Cultural and Ethical Considerations in Rural NW Ohio
Clinicians must adapt to the Midwest/rural context. As Ohio Board Director Tony Coder notes, “the more you
get out into those rural areas, the less opportunity you have for behavioral health care…combined with stigma…
[it’s] a perfect little storm” 16 . In practice, this means:
• Stigma and Trust: Many locals (farmers, working-class families, Amish/Mennonite communities) are
private and value self-reliance. They may resist labeling or therapy. Interns learn to build rapport
gradually, sometimes integrating faith or community resources. Case examples often involve
navigating stigma (e.g. a teen hesitant to see a “shrink” until a school counselor referred them).
Training emphasizes sensitivity to local culture.
• Provider Shortage: Rural sites have few clinicians. I often see clients who drove 30+ miles for an
appointment. We rely on telehealth or weekend intake clinics to reach distant patients. This scarcity
also raises ethical urgency – for instance, clinicians might extend a session to ensure patient safety if
next visit is far off.
• Dual Relationships: In small towns, clients might know clinicians socially. We discuss this in
supervision to maintain boundaries. Confidentiality is critical; one anecdote from my supervisor was
a case of mistaken identity at a church potluck that underscored extreme care with client info.
• Access and Resources: Limited transportation, poverty, and lack of Internet can impede care. I
frequently coordinate with social services or churches to arrange rides. Ethically, we must balance
ideal therapy plans with what’s feasible (e.g. scheduling text-based check-ins if video calls are
impossible).
• High-Risk Indicators: Rural NW Ohio counties have some of Ohio’s highest suicide rates 11 . The
training stresses suicide assessment and community norms (e.g. gun safety, farming accidents) in
risk management. We learn local crisis protocols and involve family or clergy when appropriate.

In all, the rural/Midwestern setting demands cultural humility. For example, approaching an older client
about depression might involve acknowledging their belief “I’m not supposed to burden others.” Ethical
training (case vignettes, role-plays) prepares interns to respect these values while advocating for care.
Each week, I find my training woven into the routine: applying evidence-based therapies learned at
Northwestern to a farming family, consulting supervisors on borderline personality issues in a tight-knit
Mennonite community, and always reflecting on ethical practice in supervision. This immersive year
combines didactics, supervision, and direct service into procedural knowledge – precisely the preparation
needed for Ohio licensure and competent rural practice.
