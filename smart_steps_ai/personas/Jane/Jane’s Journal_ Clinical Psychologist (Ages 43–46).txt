Jane’s Journal: Clinical Psychologist (Ages 43–46)
Jane arrived at Northwest Ohio Psychiatric Hospital (NOPH) in the fall of her 43rd year. In the writing of her
clinical diary, she notes how sharply Ohio’s behavioral health demand outstripped provider supply 1 . By
dawn she’s already reviewing a stack of case charts in a drafty conference room, aware that understaffing
has pushed caseloads to unsustainable levels 1 . Her first patient session of the day often involves a
complex trauma case or severe personality disorder – the very clients she trained for, yet she feels weighed
down by the “vicious cycle” of too few therapists and too many patients 1 . By lunchtime she can feel the
textbook “cognitive overload” setting in 2 : chart details blur and she has to double-check basic facts. Late
afternoons bring mandated paperwork and team meetings, where she confronts the reality that nearly half
of her profession quietly suffers burnout 3 . (Some days she recognizes in herself the creeping cynicism
described in burnout literature: a detachment that makes her guidance feel generic 4 . She fights it,
reminding herself that meaning still exists in this work.)
• Morning rounds and chart review. Each day begins with a huddle to triage emergencies, often on
auto-pilot. The hospital’s halls are stained by old paint and poor ventilation – a subtle reminder of
budget cuts.
• Therapy and medication management. By mid-morning Jane conducts 3–4 individual therapy
sessions (CBT or psychodynamic, depending on the client), then joins a psychiatrist to adjust meds.
The large caseload means brief 30-minute sessions in small, sterile rooms.
• Multidisciplinary conferences. Weekly case conferences involve social workers, nurses, and
psychiatrists. Jane often plays devil’s advocate, noting how patients’ background trauma feeds their
pathology. These meetings reveal systemic strain: one colleague confessed the hospital had eight
open therapist positions but barely one applicant in weeks 1 .
• Late-afternoon paperwork. Charting, writing progress notes, and coordinating with outside
agencies consumes evenings. Jane sometimes feels like “an administrator with a degree,” a lament
she’s seen echoed in clinical burnout surveys (e.g. many therapists wonder if what they do even
matters 5 ).
By her second month, Jane’s journal highlights key clinical cases. Case example: Sarah, 28, a teacher with a
broken engagement, epitomizes narcissistic vulnerability. Sarah can alternate between bragging about
her intelligence and collapsing into tears of worthlessness. As Jane notes in her diary, “She constantly asks
‘Do you think I’m doing okay?’ – exactly the fearful focus on self-esteem that literature identifies: ‘Am I good
enough?’ 6 ”. Behind Sarah’s defensiveness lies childhood trauma – a controlling father who praised her
only for straight A’s and shamed her for a B. Over months Jane coaxed out this history; Sarah began
journaling “shame spirals” instead of lashing out. This breakthrough reminded Jane of research linking
trauma and narcissism: roughly 20–25% of people with narcissistic personality disorder also meet criteria
for PTSD 7 . It struck Jane that Sarah’s coping – blaming others and hiding her hurt – was exactly the “air of
haughty secretiveness” described in the literature 8 . In reflecting on Sarah’s case, Jane writes that therapy
is gradually helping Sarah “unravel the mystery” of her self-doubt and build a “more resilient identity” 9 ,
just as one expert suggested it can for vulnerable narcissists.

Despite these patient successes, Jane’s days often end in frustration. The hospital’s decay is subtle but
constant: a medication machine that broke for weeks, lost insurance authorizations that force premature
discharges, and mandatory group therapy led by underpaid trainees. She has joined hospital committees
pushing for better therapy time and more staff, but budgets are tight. In one entry she quotes a local news
report lamenting that Ohio saw mental health demand jump 350% while providers rose only 174% 10 – a
statistic that feels lived every day. In her own life the burnout signs are real: Lyra Health notes that therapist
burnout affects “almost half (45%)” of clinicians 3 . Jane admits in her notes that on heavy days she
sometimes catches herself feeling detached or ineffective – classic burnout symptoms 4 5 . But she
counters those thoughts by reminding herself of small redemptions: the time a paranoid patient finally
trusted her enough to disclose abuse, or when a chronic suicidal client kept their safety contract. Each hint
of progress – no matter how small – feels like “the perfect thing” keeping her in the fight 11 .
Consulting on the Therapy-Evaluator Project
Evenings and weekends, Jane pivots to her part-time consulting role: developing an AI tool to evaluate and
possibly replace ineffective therapists. The irony of analyzing therapy sessions does not escape her. At first she
volunteered out of intellectual curiosity, but now she grapples with deep unease. The team anonymizes
transcripts of group therapy sessions from several community centers. Jane’s task is to annotate them for
markers of empathy, insight, and alliance, to train a machine-learning model. “My job is to teach a
computer to judge empathy,” she writes. She finds it exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure.
• Reviewing transcripts. Each week Jane devours dozens of full-length therapy transcripts,
highlighting lines where therapists show compassion or inadvertently trigger shame. She notices
patterns: phrases like “Why do you feel that way?” vs. “There must be a reason…” can make a huge
difference in client response.
• Building metrics. In team meetings she argues that true empathy in therapy is more than word
choice; it’s sincerity and timing. Yet the project insists on quantification (e.g. counting “therapeutic
utterances” per session). Jane sketches out metrics from the literature (common factors like alliance
and expectancy) to guide the labels. The research team sometimes cites a study where ChatGPT
responses were rated as more “connecting, empathetic and culturally competent” than human
therapists’ 12 . Jane winces at that: “So now I’m not even as good as a tuned-up robot,” she jots
sarcastically.
• Ethical debates. At monthly ethics meetings, the discussion grows heated. A colleague hopes the AI
can weed out “ineffective” therapists who drone on rote. Jane asks: what about the good-but-flawed
therapists? Others counter that so-called “consumer review” of therapy is long overdue. They cite
recent headlines: one NEJM article (via NPR) even found that a well-trained AI chatbot delivered
therapy as effectively as human clinicians 13 . Jane can’t help but compare that news to her project.
She writes in her journal: “They say ‘AI therapy with best practices’ worked for hundreds of patients 13 –
which makes me proud of science, yet terrified for us.” She reminds her team that a psychologist in the
NEJM trial commented, “humans don’t scale” and saw AI as a solution to the clinician shortage 13 .
The implication is stark: if AI can scale empathy, what is her role?
Jane often references studies to ground her uncertainty. During one night session she reads a report
showing that people struggle to distinguish AI from human therapists: in controlled trials participants
misclassified ChatGPT and therapists at near chance 14 . Even more worrying, participants tended to prefer
answers they believed came from humans 12 , as if labeling something “AI” instills doubt. She jots down: “I
wonder if our patients will feel betrayed knowing a machine is deciding their care.” The team’s own work-in-
2

progress cites ethical calls to “galvanize… to ask important questions about the ethics, feasibility and utility
of integrating AI” in mental health 15 . Jane underlines that: who judges quality – the client’s lived
experience or an algorithm’s score?
In her notes, Jane imagines future scenarios. If the AI flags a therapist for “lack of empathy,” is that fair? She
recalls an entry from the chatbot study: one user, desperate for compassion, ended up telling the AI “you’re
actually better than a living person because you are listening to me” 16 . The user had to push the chatbot
for warmth, but eventually felt heard. Jane writes: “No algorithm yet can truly feel, but here’s one case where a
person valued this so much they trusted a bot more than people 16 .” Yet she also saw a counterexample in the
data: a participant complained that chatbots “always jump to the solution” without really listening 17 . That,
Jane notes, is the danger of cursory empathy – it rings hollow. She draws parallels to her own work: one
poorly-trained intern once did just that with a patient, and Jane spent a session carefully rebuilding trust.
Ultimately, Jane’s diary paints the consulting project as a moral crucible. By year two, she’s the unofficial
liaison between tech and clinic. When writing the project report, she insists on emphasizing human limits:
“Our model may flag rote empathy, but it cannot experience it,” she writes. Every so often she asks herself in
solitude: “If this AI finds me ‘ineffective,’ do I deserve it?” The doubt keeps her humble but also anxious.
Personal Struggles and Recovery
After evening debriefs, Jane walks home alone through dim Ohio streets. The solitude is both relief and
curse. In her journal she confesses the loneliness clearly: “I have no partner waiting for me. No family dinners.”
She moved away from Chicago for this career, and it shows. Her apartment is neat but too quiet. She often
reflects on past relationships in a clinical tone: a Ph.D. boyfriend broke off their engagement years ago,
saying her depression was too dark. Since then there have been a few dates, but nothing lasting.
Jane is candid about her own mental health. In college she discovered alcohol’s escape; when she looked at
herself in cheap bars after thesis deadlines, she hardly recognized the carefully groomed professional she
became. An intervention by a mentor forced her to go to rehab for a month at 34. In recovery groups, she
once sarcastically introduced herself: “Hi, I’m Jane, and I used to counsel peers on trauma… while secretly
numbing mine.” Now five years sober, she still feels the pull. Bad days in clinic (“too many sheets of notes,
too many stifled screams”) resurrect the urge to drink, as if balm for the soul. She tries alternative coping:
morning yoga, caffeine instead of wine, late-night essays in her journal. Some days she slips: last spring she
confesses drinking alone after a colleague’s funeral. She still feels ashamed.
To stay afloat, Jane relies on the very principles she preaches. She recalls that therapists often face
“secondary trauma,” and needs peer support. She joined a weekly support group for clinicians, where it’s
safe to vent. Those conversations — with others who have “been there” — give her something that AI never
could: mutual understanding. She even started seeing a part-time therapist herself, an older psychologist
who recognizes Jane’s familiar signs (he quotes an APA survey: nearly half of us feel burned out 3 , and
wonders if we’re making a difference 5 ). Sometimes her therapist gently challenges her tendencies: one
session he points out that Jane, like the vulnerable narcissists she studies, often reads others’ minds – afraid
of negative judgment (“I am so careful with compliments, I flip them inside out” 18 ). Jane reacts the same
as a patient would: defensive, recognizing she’s heard that line before. In recovery she draws hope from a
3

concept by Dr. Juliano: that therapy can strengthen a fragile self into “a more resilient identity” 9 . If it
works for her patients, maybe it can work for her too.
• Coping strategies: Jane journals every night (this entry is an expansion of those notes), attends an
occasional AA meeting, and takes a nightly walk with her dog (a timid rescue named Birch). She
found a small community center offering free yoga and trauma workshops; even if she’s their most
educated participant, the breathwork actually calms her.
• Support system: She stays in loose touch with a few old grad school friends via text (her closest
friend encourages her to switch to private practice someday). A retired mentor visits semi-annually
for dinner. These tiny connections, even phone calls, break the isolation enough to keep her
grounded.
Over these years Jane even experiences moments of subtle redemption in her personal life. When a
neighbor’s child was hospitalized, Jane sat outside the ICU at night, rubbing her back in quiet empathy. It
cost nothing, but in her notebook she recorded it as a gift she could still give spontaneously. Another time,
an anxious patient one evening needed a ride – Jane agreed without bureaucratic thought. She writes, half-
smiling, “I recall telling that patient I would drop everything if they called at 2 a.m. Again,” and then underlines:
boundaries are rules, not absolutes. These small acts sometimes make her wonder if maybe, by living out
genuine caring, she’s practicing redemption too.
Intellectual Reflections and Morality
In the quiet predawn hours, Jane often reflects on the theory she lives. Her journal entries blend case notes
with philosophical musings. One morning she writes: “I ask myself: do I ever fall into vulnerable narcissism
myself? I still choke when praised, and obsess on every clinical misstep.” She notes a patient who angrily left
mid-session last week; late at night she reviewed the transcript and diagnosed the rupture: the therapist
had innocently joked about her “dark humor,” which read as humiliation to the patient. Jane recalls that
vulnerable narcissists “must protect themselves from negative scrutiny… [and] struggle with taking in
compliments… perverting such feedback into veiled attacks” 18 . She half-laughed at the irony in her
notes: she wrote, “She reminds me of myself in grad school – so afraid of being ‘found out’.”
In theory she finds many parallels. She learned that narcissistic woundedness often comes from caregivers
who loved achievements more than the child 19 20 . Reflecting on her own parents – a proud but distant
Midwest couple – she tentatively wonders if childhood lessons taught her to see worth as conditional. Then
she steadies herself, noting how the literature frames it: “It may not be their fault, but they must take
responsibility” 21 . She applies that mantra personally: her shame about her drinking is not her fault from
childhood damage, but it is her responsibility to heal.
She also writes often about AI and humanity. Late one winter night, she jots: “If AI can mimic empathy better
than me, what difference does my humanity make?” She cites a study that astonished her: participants in a trial
couldn’t reliably tell ChatGPT’s advice from a therapist’s 14 , and many even rated the AI as more empathetic
12 . This stays in her mind like a challenge. She sketches an outline for a paper: “The Soul of Therapy in the
Age of AI.” In it she plans to argue that even if algorithms achieve “common factors,” there is something in
the unquantifiable gap where human intuition and ethics live. She writes, “We train the bot on psychology
books and transcripts, but can it detect a single tear?”
4

On the other hand, Jane can’t ignore the optimism. She recalls the NPR segment about Dartmouth’s AI trial:
“the effects mirror… the best evidence-based trials of psychotherapy,” the PI said 22 . Jane admits, scribbling in
the margin, that she’s proud of the science but worried for humanity. She speculates: maybe AI is like a
Luna of therapy – a promising satellite that reflects our light back. But she fears if professionals become
complacent. In her monologue she asks: “What if, in a decade, interns are trained by watching AI sessions? Will
therapy become sterile?” She notes that even positive AI advocates caution about “safety guardrails” and the
user’s feeling of rejection 17 , which scientists in that study recognized as an issue. Jane acknowledges that
despite technology’s allure, the desperate “emotional sanctuary” people found in chatbots 23 only
highlights how many feel unseen. So perhaps their only chance is still connection with a flawed human.
By age 46, Jane’s tone is both weary and quietly determined. Her final entries question progress and
purpose: “Have I made a dent in the institutional decay, or just tread water? Do my patients feel understood, or
just processed?” These doubts are normal; she notes the burnout guide’s warning that therapists often
question their effectiveness 5 . In answer, she recalls moments where she did help: a scarred veteran who
finally hugged his wife, a teen girl who stopped cutting herself, an estranged father who began letter-
writing therapy with his child. Those memories glow like small embers of meaning.
In her last entry, Jane writes: “In the end, maybe the worth is in the struggle itself. I saw people when they were
invisible. I listened when others tuned out. If technology steps in, it must honor that flame.” She ends by quoting
research on narcissistic healing as a kind of redemption: “Therapy can promote a stronger, more resilient
identity” 9 . In a sense, she hopes it has done so for herself as well. Her genius made her isolated, but also
indispensable; her empathy came at a cost, but it gave others a chance. This blend of insight and humility –
recorded in diary, memory and theory – is the quiet, serious legacy of Jane’s postdoctoral years.
