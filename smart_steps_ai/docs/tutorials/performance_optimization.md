# Performance Optimization Tutorial

This tutorial guides you through optimizing the performance of the Smart Steps AI module.

## Introduction

Performance optimization is critical for ensuring that the Smart Steps AI module responds quickly and efficiently, especially when working with large datasets or in resource-constrained environments.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

1. Configure caching
2. Optimize memory usage
3. Use batch processing
4. Monitor and improve performance

## Prerequisites

- Smart Steps AI module installed
- Basic familiarity with the CLI
- A session with at least a few conversations

## Step 1: Check Current Performance

Before making any optimizations, let's check the current performance:

```bash
smart-steps-ai performance status --detailed
```

This will show you metrics like:
- Operation times
- Memory usage
- Cache statistics

Take note of these metrics as a baseline for comparison after optimizations.

## Step 2: Configure Caching

Caching is one of the most effective ways to improve performance. Let's configure the cache sizes:

```bash
# Configure memory cache size (number of items)
smart-steps-ai performance configure --cache-size 2000

# Configure disk cache size (in MB)
smart-steps-ai performance configure --disk-cache-size 500
```

The optimal cache sizes depend on your available resources and workload:
- For systems with limited memory, use smaller memory cache and larger disk cache
- For performance-critical systems, use larger memory cache

## Step 3: Enable Vector Compression

Vector compression reduces the memory footprint of embeddings:

```bash
smart-steps-ai performance configure --compression true
```

This is particularly useful for:
- Systems with limited memory
- Applications with large numbers of embeddings
- Long-running sessions

## Step 4: Optimize Batch Size

Batch processing improves throughput for bulk operations:

```bash
smart-steps-ai performance configure --batch-size 20
```

The optimal batch size depends on your workload:
- CPU-intensive operations: smaller batch size (10-20)
- I/O-intensive operations: larger batch size (30-50)

## Step 5: Run Performance Optimization

Let's run a complete performance optimization:

```bash
smart-steps-ai performance optimize
```

This will:
- Compress vectors
- Optimize memory usage
- Apply other performance optimizations

You can also run specific optimizations:

```bash
# Clear caches
smart-steps-ai performance optimize --clear-cache

# Compress vectors only
smart-steps-ai performance optimize --compress-vectors

# Optimize memory only
smart-steps-ai performance optimize --optimize-memory
```

## Step 6: Verify Performance Improvements

Let's check the performance again to see the improvements:

```bash
smart-steps-ai performance status --detailed
```

Compare these metrics with the baseline you noted earlier. You should see improvements in:
- Operation times
- Memory usage
- Cache statistics

## Step 7: Set Up Regular Optimization

For long-running applications, set up regular performance optimization:

### On Linux/macOS

Create a cron job:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add the following line to run optimization every night at 2 AM:

```
0 2 * * * smart-steps-ai performance optimize
```

### On Windows

Create a scheduled task:

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create a new task
3. Set the trigger to run daily at 2 AM
4. Set the action to run `smart-steps-ai performance optimize`

## Step 8: Monitor Performance in Real-Time

For ongoing monitoring, you can watch performance in real-time:

```bash
smart-steps-ai performance status --watch --interval 5
```

This is useful for:
- Identifying performance bottlenecks
- Verifying the impact of optimizations
- Monitoring during high-load periods

## Advanced: Programmatic Performance Optimization

For advanced users, you can also optimize performance programmatically:

```python
from smart_steps_ai.core.cache_manager import (
    cache_manager, 
    vector_cache_optimizer, 
    batch_processor, 
    performance_monitor
)
from smart_steps_ai.core.memory_optimizer import (
    vector_compressor, 
    memory_monitor
)

# Configure caching
memory_cache = cache_manager.get_cache("memory")
memory_cache.max_size = 2000

disk_cache = cache_manager.get_cache("disk")
disk_cache.max_size_mb = 500

# Configure batch processing
batch_processor.batch_size = 20

# Monitor a function
@performance_monitor.timed("my_operation")
def my_function():
    # Function code here

# Get performance report
report = performance_monitor.get_performance_report()
for operation, metrics in report.items():
    print(f"Operation: {operation}")
    print(f"  Average time: {metrics['average_time'] * 1000:.2f} ms")
    print(f"  Execution count: {metrics['execution_count']}")

# Optimize memory
memory_monitor.optimize_memory()
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check performance regularly to identify issues early.
2. **Incremental Optimization**: Start with small optimizations and verify their impact.
3. **Balance Resource Usage**: Find the right balance between memory usage and performance.
4. **Context-Specific Configuration**: Adjust configuration based on your specific environment and workload.
5. **Test Under Load**: Verify optimizations under realistic load conditions.

## Troubleshooting

### High Memory Usage

If you're still experiencing high memory usage:
- Reduce cache sizes
- Enable vector compression
- Run memory optimization more frequently
- Use memory-optimized collections for large datasets

### Slow Performance

If you're still experiencing slow performance:
- Check the performance report to identify bottlenecks
- Increase cache sizes for frequently accessed data
- Adjust batch size for your specific workload
- Consider hardware upgrades for CPU-intensive operations

### Cache Misses

If you're experiencing many cache misses:
- Increase cache sizes
- Adjust TTL (time-to-live) values
- Verify that cache keys are consistent

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to optimize the performance of the Smart Steps AI module through:
- Caching configuration
- Memory optimization
- Batch processing
- Performance monitoring

By applying these techniques, you can ensure that your application remains responsive and efficient, even under high load or with limited resources.
