# Psychometric Analysis System: Design & Implementation Plan

**Last Updated:** May 14, 2025  
**Status:** Planned - High Priority

## Overview

The Psychometric Analysis System is a critical component of the SmartSteps platform, representing **Phase 3** of the patented three-phase process. This document outlines the design and implementation plan for creating a robust psychometric analysis system that aligns with patent claims while providing meaningful insights to practitioners and clients.

## Patent Alignment

The Psychometric Analysis System directly implements these aspects of the patent application:

> "The third phase involves evaluating the questions and subsequent responses/discussions are analyzed or measured for the studied psychological constructs (social emotional and self-disclosure)."

> "To ensure precise measurement of these attributes, a detailed psychometric analysis using the Rasch model (Rasch, 1965; Wright, 1979) is performed, allowing for the quantification of communication effectiveness and emotional engagement at both the pre- and post-stages of administration."

> "Evaluation of client progress is two-level, including both a client self-report and the observation of the trained professional. Baseline, growth, and final measures of development are produced."

## Core Components

}

[System.Serializable]
public enum MeasurementLevel
{
    Baseline,
    Intermediate,
    Final
}

[System.Serializable]
public enum RaterType
{
    Client,
    Practitioner,
    System
}

[System.Serializable]
public class ConstructScore
{
    public SELConstruct Construct;
    public float RawScore;
    public float ScaledScore; // 0-10 scale
    public float? Percentile;
    public string Level; // e.g., "Developing", "Proficient", "Advanced"
    public float? PreviousScore;
    public float? Change;
    public float? TargetScore;
}

[System.Serializable]
public class AssessmentResult
{
    public string ClientId;
    public string SessionId;
    public System.DateTime Timestamp;
    public MeasurementLevel MeasurementLevel;
    public RaterType RaterType;
    
    // Construct scores
    public List<ConstructScore> ConstructScores = new List<ConstructScore>();
    
    // Narrative assessment
    public List<string> Strengths = new List<string>();
    public List<string> AreasForGrowth = new List<string>();
    public List<string> Recommendations = new List<string>();
    
    // Technical measures (for expert view only)
    public Dictionary<string, float> TechnicalMeasures = new Dictionary<string, float>();
}

[System.Serializable]
public class ResponseData
{
    public string ItemId; // Could be a scenario decision, query response, etc.
    public SELConstruct Construct;
    public float ResponseValue;
    public System.DateTime Timestamp;
    public Dictionary<string, object> Context = new Dictionary<string, object>();
}
```
