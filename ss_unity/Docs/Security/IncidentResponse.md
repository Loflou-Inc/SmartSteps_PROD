- Record all eradication actions with timestamps
- Document verification steps and results

### 4. Recovery

**Objective**: Restore systems to normal operation

**Actions**:
- Restore data from clean backups if necessary
- Verify system functionality
- Implement additional security controls
- Monitor for signs of recurrence
- Gradually restore user access

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Verify systems are clean and vulnerabilities are addressed
2. Restore essential services first
3. Conduct security testing before full restoration
4. Monitor closely during initial recovery period
5. Implement additional security controls as needed

**Documentation**:
- Document recovery timeline and milestones
- Record verification testing results
- Document new security controls implemented

### 5. Lessons Learned

**Objective**: Improve security and incident response procedures

**Actions**:
- Conduct post-incident review meeting
- Document incident timeline and response effectiveness
- Identify security improvements
- Update security policies and procedures
- Implement preventive measures
- Provide additional training if needed

**Documentation**:
- Complete incident report with full timeline
- Document root cause analysis
- Record recommendations for improvement
- Update incident response procedures as needed
