# Smart Steps Security Best Practices Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines security best practices for deploying, configuring, and using the Smart Steps AI Professional Persona module. Following these guidelines will help protect sensitive client data, maintain system integrity, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.

## 1. Authentication and Access Control

### 1.1 Multi-Factor Authentication

Always enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for administrator accounts and encourage its use for all professional users.

```python
# Configure MFA in config.py
SECURITY = {
    "require_mfa_for_admin": True,
    "recommend_mfa_for_all_users": True,
    "mfa_methods": ["app", "email", "sms"],
    "mfa_expiry_days": 30
}
```

### 1.2 Role-Based Access Control

Implement the principle of least privilege by assigning users only the permissions they need:

| Role | Recommended Permissions |
|------|------------------------|
| Administrator | Full system access, configuration, user management |
| Therapist/Facilitator | Session management, client data access, reporting |
| Supervisor | Read-only access to sessions, reporting, analytics |
| Client | Access only to their own sessions |

### 1.3 Session Management

- Configure session timeout to 15-30 minutes of inactivity
- Implement secure session tokens with appropriate expiration
- Regenerate session IDs after authentication

```python
# Recommended session configuration
SESSION = {
    "timeout_minutes": 20,
    "token_expiry_hours": 12,
    "regenerate_id_on_login": True,
    "secure_cookies": True,
    "http_only": True
}
```

## 2. Data Protection

### 2.1 Encryption

All sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest:

- Use TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- Encrypt database backups
- Use field-level encryption for personally identifiable information (PII)

```python
# Sample encryption configuration
ENCRYPTION = {
    "algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
    "key_rotation_days": 90,
    "encrypted_fields": [
        "client.full_name", 
        "client.dob",
        "client.address",
        "client.contact",
        "session.notes"
    ]
}
```

### 2.2 Data Minimization

- Only collect information necessary for the therapeutic relationship
- Implement automatic data anonymization for analytics
- Define clear data retention policies

### 2.3 Backup and Recovery

- Encrypt all backups
- Store backups in a secure, off-site location
- Regularly test restoration procedures
- Implement automated backup verification

## 3. API Security

### 3.1 API Authentication

- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for API authentication
- Implement API key rotation
- Require HTTPS for all API endpoints

### 3.2 Rate Limiting

Configure rate limiting to prevent abuse:

```python
# Recommended rate limiting configuration
RATE_LIMITING = {
    "enabled": True,
    "general_limit": "100/minute",
    "login_limit": "5/minute",
    "reset_password_limit": "3/hour",
    "ip_whitelist": ["10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12", "192.168.0.0/16"]
}
```

### 3.3 Input Validation

- Validate all input parameters 
- Implement request schema validation
- Filter and sanitize all user-generated content

## 4. Monitoring and Incident Response

### 4.1 Security Monitoring

- Enable comprehensive security logging
- Implement real-time alerts for suspicious activities
- Regularly review security logs

```python
# Logging configuration
LOGGING = {
    "security_level": "INFO",
    "log_failed_logins": True,
    "log_administrative_actions": True,
    "log_data_access": True,
    "alert_on_repeated_failures": True,
    "threshold_for_alerts": 5
}
```

### 4.2 Incident Response Plan

1. **Identification**: Detect and confirm security incidents
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document the incident and improve security measures

### 4.3 Contact Information

Maintain an up-to-date emergency contact list including:
- IT security personnel
- Legal team
- Data protection officer
- Relevant regulatory authorities

## 5. Compliance Considerations

### 5.1 HIPAA Compliance (for US healthcare settings)

- Implement BAA (Business Associate Agreements) with all service providers
- Maintain audit logs for a minimum of 6 years
- Conduct regular HIPAA training for all staff

### 5.2 GDPR Compliance (for EU data subjects)

- Implement mechanisms for data subject access requests
- Maintain detailed data processing records
- Ensure lawful basis for all data processing
- Configure appropriate data retention periods

### 5.3 Specialized Compliance for Therapeutic Settings

- Implement appropriate safeguards for therapist-client confidentiality
- Ensure compliance with professional ethical standards
- Configure appropriate documentation for informed consent

## 6. Security Configuration Checklist

Use the following checklist when deploying the Smart Steps AI Professional Persona module:

- [ ] Strong password policy implemented
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication enabled for administrative accounts
- [ ] TLS 1.3 configured for all connections
- [ ] API endpoints properly secured with authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting configured for all endpoints
- [ ] Data encryption implemented for sensitive information
- [ ] Security logging enabled and properly stored
- [ ] Automated backups configured and tested
- [ ] Regular security updates process established
- [ ] Access control roles properly configured
- [ ] Session timeout appropriately configured
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Data anonymization configured for analytics
- [ ] Compliance features enabled for relevant regulations

## 7. Security Update Procedures

### 7.1 Keeping Dependencies Updated

Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Update dependencies and check for security issues
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pip-audit
```

### 7.2 Security Patches

Apply security patches promptly:

1. Test patches in a staging environment
2. Deploy during scheduled maintenance windows when possible
3. Verify system functionality after patching
4. Document all changes

## 8. Environment-Specific Security

### 8.1 Production Environment

- Lock down file permissions
- Use a dedicated service account with minimal privileges
- Implement network segmentation
- Enable comprehensive logging

### 8.2 Development and Testing Environments

- Use sanitized data (no real client information)
- Implement separate credentials from production
- Apply the same security controls as production where feasible
