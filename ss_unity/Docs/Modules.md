# Smart Steps Modules

Smart Steps is built on a modular architecture that allows for flexibility and extensibility. This document describes the core modules and how they interact.

## 1. Assessment Module

### Purpose
Provides standardized psychological and behavioral assessments that can be administered to clients.

- Template-based assessment creation
- Multiple question types (multiple choice, Likert scale, free response)
- Automatic scoring and interpretation
- Comparison to normative data
- Progress tracking over time

### Core Classes
- `AssessmentManager`: Coordinates assessment activities
- `AssessmentTemplate`: Defines structure of an assessment
- `AssessmentInstance`: A completed assessment for a specific client
- `QuestionBase`: Base class for different question types
- `ScoringEngine`: Handles calculation of assessment results

## 2. Intervention Module

### Purpose
Provides structured therapeutic interventions and exercises for clients.

### Features
- Interactive therapeutic activities
- Evidence-based intervention protocols
- Customizable intervention parameters
- Real-time progress monitoring
- Multi-media content integration (audio, video, images)

### Core Classes
- `InterventionManager`: Coordinates intervention activities
- `InterventionTemplate`: Defines structure of an intervention
- `InterventionInstance`: A specific intervention session
- `ActivityBase`: Base class for different activity types
- `ResponseRecorder`: Captures client responses and interactions

## 3. Progress Tracking Module

### Purpose
Monitors and analyzes client progress over time across multiple dimensions.

### Features
- Custom goal setting and tracking
- Visual progress representations
- Progress alerts and notifications
- Outcome measurement
- Trend analysis

### Core Classes
- `ProgressManager`: Coordinates progress tracking
- `Goal`: Represents a measurable client goal
- `Milestone`: Significant points within a goal
- `ProgressMetric`: Measurable data point
- `TrendAnalyzer`: Identifies patterns in progress data

## 4. Reporting Module

### Purpose
Generates professional reports and visualizations for documentation and communication.

### Features
- Templated report generation
- Custom report design
- Multiple export formats (PDF, Excel, etc.)
- Interactive data visualizations
- Batch reporting capabilities

### Core Classes
- `ReportManager`: Coordinates report generation
- `ReportTemplate`: Defines structure of a report
- `ReportInstance`: A generated report
- `ChartGenerator`: Creates visual data representations
- `ExportEngine`: Handles exporting to various formats

## 5. Client Management Module

### Purpose
Manages client information, session history, and case management.

### Features
- Client profiles and demographics
- Session scheduling and history
- Document management
- Client grouping and filtering
- Case notes and documentation

### Core Classes
- `ClientManager`: Coordinates client management
- `ClientProfile`: Contains client information
- `SessionHistory`: Records of past sessions
- `DocumentLibrary`: Manages client-related documents
- `NoteSystem`: Handles clinical notes

## 6. Security Module

### Purpose
Ensures data protection, privacy compliance, and appropriate access controls.

### Features
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption
- Authentication services
- Audit logging
- Privacy compliance tools

### Core Classes
- `SecurityManager`: Coordinates security features
- `AuthenticationService`: Handles user login
- `EncryptionService`: Manages data encryption
- `AuditLogger`: Records system activity
- `PrivacyManager`: Handles consent and data protection

## Module Interaction

Modules communicate through the `SmartStepsManager` using event-based architecture:

```
[Assessment Module] ↔ [SmartStepsManager] ↔ [Progress Module]
         ↑                    ↑                   ↑
         |                    |                   |
         ↓                    ↓                   ↓
[Intervention Module] ↔ [Client Module] ↔ [Reporting Module]
                            ↑
                            |
                            ↓
                     [Security Module]
```

## Extending Modules

New functionality can be added to Smart Steps by:

1. Creating new module implementations that follow the standard module interface
2. Registering modules with the `SmartStepsManager`
3. Implementing required data models and UI components
4. Adding appropriate security controls

## Module Development Guidelines

When developing new modules:

- Follow the established architectural patterns
- Implement the `IModule` interface
- Use events for cross-module communication
- Maintain separation of concerns
- Include comprehensive XML documentation
- Add appropriate unit tests
- Consider accessibility in all UI components
