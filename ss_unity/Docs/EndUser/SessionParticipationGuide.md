## During Your Session

### Getting Comfortable with the AI Persona

Remember that the AI persona:
- Is designed to support your growth and learning
- Has been developed with professional therapeutic principles
- Will respond to your questions and comments naturally
- Is overseen by your human facilitator throughout the session

It's normal to feel a bit strange talking to an AI at first. Most people find it becomes natural quite quickly.

### Effective Participation

#### Communication Tips

- **Speak or Type Clearly**: Express yourself as you normally would in conversation
- **Be Specific**: The more specific your comments, the more helpful the responses
- **Ask Questions**: If something isn't clear, just ask for clarification
- **Take Your Time**: There's no rush - pause and reflect when needed
- **Express Emotions**: Share how you're feeling about topics you discuss
- **Be Honest**: The more genuine you are, the more helpful the session will be

#### Working with Your Facilitator

Your human facilitator is there to:
- Guide the overall session
- Help if communication with the AI becomes challenging
- Provide additional insights or clarification
- Ensure the session stays aligned with your goals
- Support you if difficult emotions arise

Feel free to address questions or comments to your facilitator at any time.

### What to Expect

#### Session Structure

A typical session follows this format:

1. **Check-in**: Brief review of how you're doing and any developments since last session
2. **Goal Setting**: Clarifying the focus for today's session
3. **Main Discussion**: Conversation about the primary topic or skill practice
4. **Reflection**: Considering insights and learning from the conversation
5. **Next Steps**: Planning for between-session activities or focus points
6. **Wrap-up**: Summarizing the session and scheduling next meeting

#### Conversation Flow

The conversation will feel much like talking with a human professional, with:
- Questions to explore your thoughts and feelings
- Reflections on what you've shared
- Information relevant to your situation
- Suggestions for techniques or approaches to try
- Connections to previous discussions or patterns

## After Your Session

### Integration

To get the most from your Smart Steps experience:

- **Reflect**: Take a few minutes to consider key insights from the session
- **Journal**: Writing down thoughts and reactions can deepen learning
- **Practice**: Apply new skills or perspectives in daily situations
- **Notice**: Pay attention to patterns related to session topics
- **Follow-up**: Complete any agreed-upon activities

### Feedback

Your input helps improve your experience:

- Share what was helpful or unhelpful with your facilitator
- Note any technical issues to report
- Consider what you'd like to focus on in future sessions
- Complete any feedback forms provided

## Special Situations

### Technical Difficulties

If you experience problems during a session:

1. Stay calm - technical issues occasionally happen
2. Try refreshing your browser or restarting the application
3. Contact technical support using the provided contact information
4. If the issue persists, your facilitator will help reschedule

### Emotional Responses

It's normal for therapeutic conversations to sometimes trigger strong emotions:

- Take a moment to acknowledge how you're feeling
- Communicate your emotional state to your facilitator
- Use any coping strategies you've developed
- Remember you can take a break if needed
- Your facilitator can provide additional support

### Privacy Concerns

If you have concerns about privacy during sessions:

- Discuss these with your facilitator at the beginning of the session
- Review the privacy information provided in your enrollment materials
- Request clarification about how your information is used and protected
- Remember you can limit what you share until you feel comfortable
