# Smart Steps Informed Consent Form

## INFORMED CONSENT FOR PARTICIPATION IN SMART STEPS PROGRAM

This form provides information about the Smart Steps program and asks for your informed consent to participate. Please read carefully and ask any questions before signing.

### NATURE OF SERVICE

Smart Steps is an AI-assisted therapeutic tool that combines human facilitation with artificial intelligence technology. The program is designed to:

- Support personal growth and skill development
- Provide practice opportunities in a supportive environment
- Complement traditional therapy or coaching
- Offer consistent access to therapeutic conversations

Smart Steps is not a replacement for emergency services, crisis intervention, or comprehensive mental health treatment.

### STRUCTURE OF SERVICES

The Smart Steps program includes:

- Individual sessions with an AI professional persona overseen by a human facilitator
- Session length of approximately [30-60] minutes
- Frequency of sessions as determined by your facilitator ([weekly/biweekly/monthly])
- Program duration of approximately [X weeks/months]
- Optional between-session activities and practice opportunities

### THE ROLE OF AI TECHNOLOGY

Smart Steps uses artificial intelligence technology that:

- Engages in conversation based on therapeutic principles
- Maintains memory of previous sessions for continuity
- Adapts to your specific needs and communication style
- Is always supervised by a human facilitator

I understand that the AI:
- Is not a human and does not truly "understand" emotions as humans do
- Has limitations in processing complex situations
- Works best as a complement to human professional support
- Is continually being improved and may occasionally respond in unexpected ways

### THE ROLE OF YOUR FACILITATOR

Your human facilitator will:
- Guide the overall therapeutic process
- Observe and participate in all sessions
- Provide expertise and judgment the AI cannot
- Ensure the quality and appropriateness of the experience
- Address any concerns or difficulties that arise

### POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND RISKS

**Potential Benefits:**
- Convenient access to supportive conversations
- Consistent practice environment
- Safe space to explore thoughts and feelings
- Development of specific skills relevant to your goals
- Insights from patterns across sessions

**Potential Risks and Limitations:**
- The AI may occasionally misunderstand or respond inappropriately
- Some people may feel uncomfortable interacting with AI technology
- Technical issues might interrupt sessions
- The program may not address all needs or be suitable for all conditions
- As with any therapeutic approach, discussing challenging topics may sometimes be uncomfortable

### CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY

Your privacy is important to us. Information from your Smart Steps participation is:
- Kept confidential in accordance with professional standards and applicable laws
