## Technology and AI

### How does the AI work?
The AI uses natural language processing to understand your words and context, then generates responses based on therapeutic principles and the specific persona you're working with. It maintains memory of your conversations to provide continuity.

### Can the AI truly understand my problems?
The AI can recognize patterns, emotions, and themes in your communication, but it doesn't "understand" in the way humans do. This is why the human facilitator is an essential part of the process - they provide the human understanding and guidance.

### Will the AI remember what we discussed last time?
Yes, the system is designed to maintain context between sessions, allowing for continuity in your conversations.

### Is the AI judging me?
No. The AI is programmed to be non-judgmental and supportive. It responds to your communication without forming opinions about you as a person.

### What if the AI misunderstands me?
If you feel misunderstood, you can:
- Clarify or rephrase your statement
- Directly indicate that the response wasn't what you meant
- Ask your facilitator for assistance
- Provide feedback about the misunderstanding

### Are my sessions recorded?
Session content is stored securely to maintain continuity between sessions and allow your facilitator to review. Whether audio/video is recorded depends on your specific program and consent.

### How long is my data kept?
Data retention periods vary based on your program, professional requirements, and local regulations. Typical retention periods range from 3-7 years, after which data is securely deleted.

### Can I request my data be deleted?
