# Smart Steps Architecture

## Overview

Smart Steps is a psychological tool designed to assist professionals in mental health and rehabilitation. The application is built on Unity to provide cross-platform compatibility across web and mobile platforms.

## Core Components

### 1. SmartStepsManager

The central controller of the application that manages:
- User authentication and profiles
- Session management
- Data persistence
- System configuration

### 2. Module System

Smart Steps is built around a modular architecture where different therapeutic approaches are encapsulated as modules:

- **AssessmentModule**: For conducting standardized assessments
- **InterventionModule**: For guided therapeutic interventions
- **ProgressTrackingModule**: For monitoring client progress over time
- **ReportingModule**: For generating professional reports and visualizations

### 3. Data Model

The core data model consists of:

- **User**: Professionals using the system
- **Client**: Individuals receiving services
- **Session**: A therapeutic session with a client
- **Assessment**: Structured evaluation tool
- **Intervention**: Therapeutic approach or exercise
- **ProgressRecord**: Tracking data points over time

### 4. UI System

The UI is designed to be:
- Professional and clinical in appearance
- Accessibility-compliant
- Responsive across devices
- Configurable based on user preferences

## Security Considerations

- All client data is encrypted at rest
- Session data is stored locally until explicitly synchronized
- Authentication uses industry-standard protocols
- Regular security audits of codebase

## Extensibility

The system is designed for extensibility:
- New modules can be added without modifying core components
- Assessment templates can be added via configuration
- Intervention protocols can be extended
- Reporting formats are templated for customization

## Future Roadmap

- Cloud synchronization
- Multi-user collaboration
- Advanced analytics and outcome measures
- Integration with electronic health records
- Machine learning for personalized interventions

## Development Guidelines

- All code should be well-documented with XML comments
- Core functionality must include unit tests
- UI components should be tested for accessibility
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
