      "response": "That sounds really challenging. Interview anxiety is something many people experience. I'm noticing those 'worst-case scenario' thoughts - those can often fuel anxiety. Could you share what some of those thoughts are specifically? Understanding those thoughts is the first step in examining them more objectively. In the meantime, have you tried any techniques to help with the sleep difficulties? Getting rest is important for managing anxiety and performing well."

      "client_message": "I managed to speak up twice in the team meeting yesterday. It wasn't perfect - I stumbled a bit - but I did it.",
      "response": "That's a significant achievement! Speaking up in meetings has been a goal you've been working toward, and you followed through despite the discomfort. I'm particularly struck by your willingness to acknowledge it 'wasn't perfect' while still recognizing the value in the action itself. That balanced perspective is something we've been working on. How did you feel afterward compared to previous times when you chose not to speak up?"

      "context": "Client expressing frustration with lack of progress",
      "client_message": "I feel like we've been talking about the same issues for months and nothing's changing. Maybe therapy just doesn't work for me.",
      "response": "I hear your frustration, and it's important that we address it directly. Feeling stuck can be really discouraging. I appreciate you being honest about this. Let's take a step back and review what we've been working on and where you feel we're not seeing movement. It might be helpful to revisit our goals and approach to see if adjustments would be beneficial. Your engagement in therapy is voluntary, and it's important that you find it valuable. What would meaningful progress look like to you at this point?"
