# SmartSteps Implementation Plan (REFACTORED)

**Last Updated:** May 14, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development - Refactoring Phase

## Purpose of This Document

This STEP_PLAN outlines the refactored implementation roadmap for the SmartSteps platform, designed to ensure alignment between:
1. Patent application claims
2. System architecture
3. Development priorities

The goal is to create a comprehensive psychological assessment tool with scenario-based interactions, evaluative discussions, and rigorous analytics, supported by AI personas to enhance practitioner-client experiences.

## Core Components & Implementation Status

| AI Persona Module | ✅ Nearly Complete | Strong | High |
| Scenario Engine | ❌ Not Implemented | Critical | Highest |
| Query/Evaluation Phase | ⚠️ Partial | Moderate | High |
| Psychometric Analysis | ❌ Not Implemented | Critical | High |
| Anonymous Client System | ❌ Not Implemented | Strong | Medium |
| Role-based Access | ⚠️ Partial | Moderate | Medium |
| VR/Voice Extensions | ❌ Future Phase | Future | Low |

## Three-Phase Process Implementation

The three-phase approach is central to the patent application. Each phase must be implemented to establish patent alignment:

### Phase 1: Scenario Engine (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- Create structured scenarios with decision points
- Support branching narrative paths based on client choices
- Capture choice data for later analysis
- Allow practitioners to select and customize scenarios

### Phase 2: Query Phase
- Support AI-facilitated follow-up questions based on scenario outcomes
- Enable practitioner-led discussions with guidance
- Capture response data for analysis
- Link responses to specific scenario choices

### Phase 3: Evaluation & Analysis
- Implement Rasch model-based psychometric analysis
- Measure social emotional constructs (self-awareness, self-management, etc.)
- Generate quantitative metrics and qualitative insights
- Support two-level evaluation (client self-report and practitioner observation)
